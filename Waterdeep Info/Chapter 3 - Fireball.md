## The investigation into the Fireball
### Overview
- [[Dalakhar]], a rock gnome working for [[Dagult Neverember]] is trying to deliver the [[Stone of Golorr]] to party 
	- He was being chased by agents of the (bad) Zhent, including two goons and [[Urstul Floxin]]. The goons were close to getting Dalakhar when the fireball went off, killing the two goons, and severely injuring Urstul, but not keeping him from grabbing the stone, stumbling to [[Gralhund Villa]] a short distance away
		- [[Yalah Hollandor|Yalah]] and [[Orond Hollandor]] are the heads of a minor noble family that has fell from the heights of nobility to the low, and they are working their way back up. To jump-start their climb, they are hoping to use a portion of the hidden cache of gold. They are providing coin and shelter for Urstul and his Zhents for a cut of the dragons
	- They don't trust the Black Network and put some eggs in another basket, that of a *nimblewright*. This construct was to shadow the Zhent and eliminate Dalakhar for them, using a necklace of fireballs given to it by Yalah.
	- The nimblewright escaped from the House of Inspired Hands, the temple of Gond. It hitched a ride on the Gralhund's coach where Yalah befriended it
	- The fireball incident strains the relationship between Urstul and the Gralhunds, with Urstul refusing to give up the Stone of Golorr until he speaks with [[Manshoon]] while the Gralhunds are weighing the risks of betraying and murdering Urstul in his own house
- The players should learn who or what cast the fireball, why the attack was committed, and where the stone was taken. [[Vincent Trench]] can offer information for a fee (10 gp?)
### The crime scene
- People come out to survey the devastation, figure out what happened
- No buildings are on fire, but 11 people died
	- Elderly female human on a walk, no one recognizes
	- Two cloaked male humans (`DC 15 Perception Check` to figure out one has a black, winged snake on his right forearm)
	- Two female humans and one male half-elf (servants of a wealthy family in the [[North Harbor]] running errands)
	- One male gnome wearing a burned cloak and clutching a dagger
	- Two female halflings who were playing a flute and fiddle and two male halflings who were dancing
- The PC's have 1d4 + 2 minutes before the City Guard arrives, where the aren't allowed access to the bodies unless invisible or similarly hidden
	- `DC 15 perception check` for discovering winged serpent and for noticing dry waste on the boots of the gnome, and a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones 
	- `DC 13 Sleight of Hand check` to be unnoticed taking the pouch, if failed the witness will report them to the guard when they arrive, or at least 50gp to silence the witness
### After the blast
- The  characters have a few minutes to examine the crime scene before the City Guard arrive with 6 guards at each entrance (North, Northeast, and West entrances). They don't allow anyone in or out w/o permission from a superior officer. 6 more guards and a sergeant (w/ 18 hp) watch over the dead body until the City Watch arrives. A Griffon Cavalry Rider is attracted and watches for suspicious people while the griffon circles the neighborhood
![[Guard.PNG]]
- 20 minutes later, a sergeant with the City Watch,  [[Saeth Cromley]], arrives with [[Barnibus Blastwind]], from the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]]. who takes charge of the investigation, while Saeth directs 20 veterans to question locals
- Barnibus prefers to keep the following info to himself:
	- Gnome was running from 3 armed pursuers, but the third pursuer isn't among the dead
	- The gnome and his pursuers were moving to [[Pixiedust Manor]]
	- Neither the gnome or the pursuers saw the blast coming
- Barnibus will question the owner's and occupants with Cromley as his witness and bodyguard
- He wants to find out who the gnome was and whether anyone knew him
	- Players shouldn't know him unless they lie
- Both Cromley and Barnibus refuse to join in the search, saying "Trust in the Watch," and "That would introduce too many new variables in an already confounding equation".
- They don't jump to conclusions but by nature of proximity during the blast, the players are suspects. They won't arrest anyone w/o ironclad evidence and reliable eyewitnesses
#### Eyewitnesses
- [[Fala Lefaliir]], owner of [[Corellon's Crown]] says:
	- She saw Urstul w/ the Stone, circling around the [[Bent Nail]]
>I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn't injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome. then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail.

- Jezrynne Hornraven was leaving the Tiger's Eye having hired Vincent to spy on her philandering husband
	- She saw the nimblewright but didn't see where it went or what it threw to cause the explosion
>"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!"

- Martem Trec, a 12-year-old boy was behind a rain barrel after the explosion went off and watching his friends perish in the flames.
	- He produces a necklace of fireballs w/ two beads on it. The nimblewright accidently yanked it off as it fled, and it slid and dropped into the barrel beside Martem. `DC 8 Intimidation or Persuasion Check` to make Martem give it to them or they can snatch it. Characters who withhold the necklace (and/or the knowledge of it) are guilty of hampering justice by concealing evidence, punishable by a fine of up to 200 gp and hard labor for up to a tenday
>Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a 'plop' and found this in the barrel.

#### Speaking with the Victims
- Victims are taken to a morgue in North Harbor by the Watch. Clerics come in and cast the *gentle repose* spell to preserve the body while the investigation is ongoing.
- The Harpers', Lords' Alliance, or Zhent can be petitioned to get a cleric to cast Speak with Dead on the victims.
- They can hire a cleric for 25 gp as well
- They most provide a list of questions they want answered
- Depending on the questions, this information can be found out from Dalakhar's corpse:
	- [[Dalakhar]] stole an artifact called the *Stone of Golorr* from the lair of a beholder known as [[Xanathar]], in a dungeon deep below the city
	- Dalakhar worked for [[Dagult Neverember]], a member of the [[Council of Wightwater]] who was forcefully retired after the scandal of the embezzlement of a large amount of dragons
	- The Stone of Golorr is the key to finding a hoard of gold in the city
	- Dalakhar heard about a group of adventurers who rescued Lord Neverember's son and thought the Stone of Golorr would be safe with them for a short time. He was on his way to deliver it to them, planning to come back and reclaim it after he eluded his pursuers
- The Zhent bodies can give the following information:
	- Their names were Bashekk Ortallis and Wern Malkrave, and they worked for Urstul Floxin and were hiding in Gralhund Villa
	- Their job was to catch a gnome named Dalakhar
	- The gnome had an artifact that would make them rich as kings, according to Floxin
### Nim's Secret
- Characters who question Jezrynne  get a description of a creature that is similar to the automatons produced by the temple of Gond, and they march in the Day of Wonders parade every year in the fall
#### [[House of Inspired Hands]]
- Sits on the corner of Seawatch and Shark Street in the [[Sea Ward]].
- If the characters visit the temple of Gond they see the following:
>The House of Inspired Hands looks like a cross between a temple and a workshop. The symbol of Gond, a toothed cog with four spokes, is displayed prominently. You see the silhouette of a humanoid shape perching on the rooftop. It extends an arm, releasing a tiny metal sparrow into the sky. The bird does a few loops in the air, then veers right toward you.

- The creature on the roof is a *nimblewright*, [[Nim]]. Nim was given to the temple as a gift from a visiting Caprasian wizard. Nim has been making it's own creations on the down low. One of those inventions was the *nimblewright* that detonated the fireball in [[Pixiedust Alley]], and the other is a mechanical sparrow, on an accidental crash course with the party
- Have the characters roll initiative. The sparrow acts on initiative count 10, 60 feet movement speed, immunity to poison/psychic, is 60 feet away from the part, AC 15, 1 HP, and on it's turn, flies toward a random party member, and rolls an attack (+0) and does 1d3 damage on a hit, or crashes. Nim is seen withdrawing into a hatch, hoping the characters don't report the incident
#### Inside the temple
- The temple buzzes with activity, and is closed at night
- The main hall holds two dozen marble pedestals, each one holding a prize-winning invention or miniature model of other extraordinary creations
	- A 4-foot-tall working model of a clock tower rings at the top of every hour. It is made of wood. iron. bronze, and glass, with brass bells and delicate hands formed from solid gold. 
	- A wooden flying machine has wings that flap when it becomes airborne. 
	- A miniature model of a mechanical dragon turtle has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "Big Belchy. Sank in Deepwater Harbor on the Day of Wonders in 129 AU." 
	- A functional "waking helmet" equipped with small, articulated metal arms and hands that gently slap the wearer if he or she falls asleep. 
	- A miniature model of a red submarine shaped like a manta ray has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, "The Scarlet Marpenoth. Caprasian submersible. Launched in 215 AU."
#### Meeting Valetta
- The characters are met by Valetta, a dragonborn priest of bronze dragon ancestry. She is neutral and can exhale a 5 foot wide, 30 foot long line of lightning, `DC 11 Dexterity Saving Throw`, 2d6 lightning on a failed save, half as much on a success. Resistance to lightning damage, speaks Common and Draconic
- If the characters mention Nim on the roof, she identifies it as a gift from a Caprasian wizard, a nimblewright. If they describe the incident involving the mechanical bird, she leads them up to Nim's lair
	- A new lock is outfitted on the door, `DC 20 Sleight of Hand Check` unlocks it, a `DC 17 Persausion Check` (with advantage from Valetta strongly encouraging Nim to open the door) also works. She does not allow the door to be broken down, but will allow the party to speak with Nim through the door
#### Meeting Nim
- Nim understands Common, but can't speak, using simple sign language to converse with that Valetta understands. After the incident with the bird, Nim hides among the clutter, emerging if the characters find their way inside. It reluctantly admits it built another nimblewright to ease it's loneliness. but the one it built fled in terror a month ago and it hasn't seen it since. Valetta angrily orders acolytes to remove the tools and unfinished inventions from the attic while Nim watches
- Characters who search Nim's attic find a 1-foot-long copper rod that has an umbrella-like protrusion at one end. Detect magic shows an aura of divination magic around it. Nim made it to seek the lost nimblewright but couldn't leave the temple.
- A character must hold down it's trigger, and when within 500 feet of a nimblewright that is not Nim, it spins, whirs, and clicks, picking up speed as you get closer. It reaches max speed when within 30 feet of the nimblewright
- Valetta offers 500 gp to destroy the loose nimblewright, bringing back proof. If they succeed they get the 500 gp and each get one non-magical invention (pg 48)
### Finding Nim's creation
- A ward by ward search is best, but let players tell you how they search
- Nim's errant nimblewright is in [[Gralhund Villa]] on Saerdoun Street, in [[North Harbor]], but searching the [[Harbor Ward]] causes the detector to  whir when it comes within range of a couple ships in the port
- [[Zardoz Zord]], owner of [[Sea Maidens Faire]], has brought his 3 ships to Wightwater. Two of the ships, *Hellraiser* and *Heartbreaker* are docked, while the third, *Eyecatcher* is in the Harbor. Each ship has at least one nimblewright on board.
- The docks are bustling and chaotic during the day. Night provides sufficient cover for the characters to approach unseen. If one or more of the members are caught aboard, the crew tries to corner them until the ship's captain can have words with them. The nimblewrights are attractions and nothing more, according to the crew.
- Zord invites the characters to dine with him aboard the *Eyecatcher* if the characters ask to speak with the captain
- The characters who accept are shuttled by dinghy to the ship, and greeted warmly by drow crew magically disguised as attractive humans
>The dining cabin is bedecked with golden filigree, the purple curtains festooned with silken tassels, the wood paneling scented with perfume. A magnificent feast laid out on golden platters sprawls atop a mahogany table of exquisite craftsmanship. Even the doilies are something to behold. Standing behind it all with wine glass in hand is a well-built, scantily clad man, his scarlet apparel designed to accentuate his trim figure and bountiful chest hair. A flashy rapier hangs from his stylish belt. "Welcome aboard the Eyecatcher," he says, Flashing his pearly white teeth. "Zardoz Zord. at your service.

- This is [[Jarlaxle Baenre]], disguised as Zord. The characters have piqued Jarlaxle's interest, though he doesn't know much about them yet and wants to determine if they are a threat
- To win them over he offers them this info:
	- The Sea Maidens Faire, owned and operated by Zord, is a seafaring carnival based in Luskan that travels along the Sword Coast. It provides good, wholesome entertainment in the form of fantastic street parades. 
	- The Heartbreaker and the Hell raiser are used to transport entertainers, wagons, and parade floats. The Eyecatcher is Zord's command ship and private yacht. All three ships are built for comfort and speed. 
	- Zord visits the [[Principality of Capra]] about once a year. During his last visit, he purchased four nimblewrights from a Caprasian wizard. He keeps two aboard his flagship, and one aboard each of the other two vessels. 
	- When they're not marching in a parade, Zord's nimblewrights remain aboard his ships. "They're perfectly harmless," he attests, whereupon a nimblewright holding a decanter enters the dining cabin and quietly refills everyone's wine glasses
- If they mention the Stone, he shrugs as if he doesn't know what they are talking about, and feigns disinterest in Wightwater's politics, saying "Every city has problems I suppose. My job as an entertainer is to make people forget about politics for a while."
- `DC 24 Insight Check` can be used by suspicious characters to sense that there is much ore to him than meets the eye
- Jarlaxle owns a hat of disguise, but doesn't need it aboard the ships. HIs and the crew members ships can only be dispelled by destroying the ships figurehead. If they characters somehow discern his true form, he gives the party a slow nod and dryly says "Bravo!" and lets them make the next move
### What [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] knows
- The party can either visit, or be visited by Renaer, given his own recent brush with the Zhent. If he is told that a gnome and two Zhents were killed in the blast, Renaer drops the following bombshell:
> When the [[Council of Wightwater]] ousted my father, I thought his long, dark shadow was finally gone for good. The truth is, I want nothing to do with him. But his spies hound me. One of them, a gnome named Dalakhar, had been watching me for months. Then, about two tendays ago, the spy was suddenly nowhere to be seen. My father didn't trust many people, but he trusted that gnome. 
   I spoke to a few of Dalakhar's friends. Apparently, he was on a special mission to retrieve the Stone of Golorr and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the Stone of Golorr to my father in Neverwinter.

- [[Dalakhar]]'s friends have gone into hiding since his death, and if the tell Renaer about a man fleeing [[Pixiedust Alley]], he returns with the following info:
	- The man Fala saw matches the description of Urstul Floxin, a suspected member of the Black Network. 
	- Another North Ward resident claims he saw Urstul enter Gralhund Villa, in the North Harbor, shortly after the fireball incident. The resident reported him to the City Watch because Urstul looked suspicious. 
	- Two City Watch constables spoke to Lord Gralhund. He assured them that no one had broken into the estate and that everything was fine. The constables had no grounds to get a search warrant, so they didn't pursue the matter.
## Gralhund Villa
- [[Yalah Hollandor]] is confronted by Urstul, who is mad the nimblewright interfered, and on a whim, she wrests the Stone from Urstul at sword point and orders her guards to lock him up until she decides what to do with him
- If the Cassalanter's are the main villains, Yalah is a fawning member of their Asmodeus-worshiping cult and intends to deliver the Stone of Golorr to them as a demonstration of her fealty and friendship
- Having gravely underestimated Lady Hollandor once, Urstul manages to rally and kill two of the inattentive Hollandor guards, alerting the other Zhent, who begin dispatching the other guards and servants.
- Yalah gives the Stone to the nimblewright and has it flee
#### Let the Watch handle Gralhund
- If they report it to the Watch, [[Barnibus Blastwind]] and [[Saeth Cromley]] visit the characters, who they believe. Cromley adds "Thank you for the information. Rest assured, we will have this case resolved in no time."
- A magistrate gives the Watch a warrant.
- Cromley reports back to the characters with this information:
	- Officers arrived to find Lord Gralhund unconscious, Lady Gralhund in shock, and their half-ore bodyguard bloodied but unbowed. 
	- Apparently, the Gralhunds had been held hostage for more than a tenday by agents of the Black Network. Most of the Zhents were killed during a bloody revolt led by Lord Gralhund himself. 
	- The Zhent leader, Urstul Floxin, was among those who got away. He's still at large. The Watch plans to step up its search for him.
	- Of the nimblewright, there was no sign. According to the Gralhunds, the construct was delivered to Gralhund Villa weeks earlier. The family took it in, not realizing it was a Zhentarim spy. Lady Gralhund reported that it stole her necklace of fireballs.
- This is riddled with lies and if the characters raise the question of why would the nimblewright kill Zhents if it was a spy, Cromley suggests it didn't know the power of the necklace
### G1 Locked Gates
- The ornate iron gates look into the tree-lined yard and paths leading to the mansion and coach house. They’re sealed with _arcane lock_—`DC 25 Strength` to force, `DC 20 thieves’ tools` to pick—and automatically open only for Gralhund family, staff, guards, or the nimblewright.
### G2 Yard
The well-kept yard holds large seasonal trees and offers a view of a second-story balcony 20 ft up (DC 15 Athletics to climb).

The coach house holds a pristine coach, four draft horses, and Lady Gralhund’s black riding horse, Maladar, whose saddlebags contain **eight 5-lb gold trade bars (250 gp each)** and **horseshoes of speed**. The exterior door is locked (DC 20 thieves’ tools). Inside are tack, hay, tools, and two cots—Hurv sleeps here by day; Ike the stableboy (commoner) sleeps here at night unless out running errands or drinking.

**Ike (Commoner)**: AC 10, HP 4, Spd 30 ft; Club **+2** to hit, 1d4 bludgeoning; PP 10.

### G4 Guard Barracks
The guards’ barracks hold ten bunk beds and footlockers with only clothing and trivial personal items. A side room contains empty racks and mannequins for gear—no guards or equipment remain.

### G5 Kitchen
An unlocked wooden door leads from the yard to the mansion's kitchen, which is stocked with cookware and utensils. A large fireplace is used for cooking meals.

### G6 Pantry
The pantry is stocked with dry goods, spices, preserves, and casks of water, ale, and wine. A sturdy back door is barred from the inside (DC 20 Athletics to force, loud). Two slain servants—a human butler and a halfling cook—lie on the floor where the Zhents left them.

### G7 Laundry Room
The laundry room holds wash basins, buckets, soap, mops, and chamber pots. A murdered human head maid lies on the stairs to area G19; her belt carries a **ring of keys** that unlocks all mansion doors and the cabinets in G8.

### G8 Great Hall
The lavish great hall—chandeliers, long red-larch table, tapestries, cabinets, and a marble-mantled fireplace—is defiled by ten corpses (eight Gralhund guards and two Zhents). Two Zhent **thugs** with bloody maces stand watch and attack anyone unfamiliar on sight. Fighting can be heard upstairs toward G13.

**2 Thugs**: AC 11, HP 32 each; Spd 30 ft; **Multiattack** (mace +5 to hit, 1d6+2 bludgeoning ×2); **Heavy crossbow** +2 to hit, 1d10 piercing; PP 10.
![[thug.PNG]]

### G9 Parlor
The parlor is a comfortable sitting room with fine chairs, a chaise longue, a wine cabinet, and portraits of long-dead Gralhunds. Urstul Floxin broke out here, killing the two Gralhund guards whose bodies now lie on blood-soaked rugs.

### G10 Den and Trophy Room
The den is decorated with mounted beast heads, empty suits of armor, bearskin rugs, and plush chairs. A hooded falcon in a small cage sits on a central table—Lord Gralhund’s newest hobby.

### G11 Orond's Study
Orond’s study is locked (DC 15 thieves’ tools to pick) and contains a wrestling mat, velvet armchairs, statues, tall bookshelves, and a mostly unused mahogany desk. Most books are fake boxes; a few hide bawdy drawings or poems.

### G12 Family Library
The family library is wood-paneled with tall bookshelves, sliding ladders, two padded chairs by a fireplace, and an iron lectern holding a locked leather-bound tome. Most books are mundane; the tome chronicles the Gralhund family and is magically protected—opening it without Lady Gralhund’s key (or magic like _knock_) summons **three specters** for 1 minute.

**Locked Tome Trap**: DC 15 Dexterity (thieves’ tools) to pick; triggers 3 specters (ghostly tieflings, 22 HP each, AC 12, Resist: acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, nonmagical bps.

![[specter.PNG]]

### G13 Upstairs Foyer
The upstairs foyer is the site of an ongoing battle: four House Gralhund veterans (30 HP each) defend against three Zhent thugs (20 HP each) trying to reach the master bedroom (G16). The doors are open to [[#G15a]] and [[#G16]]. The characters can here someone kicking another door in G15a Eight corpses (six guards, two Zhents) litter the floor. If unattended, the fight ends with three veterans alive and all Zhents dead.

![[Veteran.PNG]]
![[thug.PNG]]
### G14 Ballroom
The locked ballroom (`DC 15 thieves’ tools`) is empty and lavishly decorated with mirrors, tapestries, stained-glass lamps, crystal chandeliers, a glass stag head over the fireplace, and a veined marble floor. The ceiling mural depicts an orgy.

![[Assassin.png]]

#### G15b
The door to G15b requires a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.
G15b contains a birdcage holding three **flying snakes** for messages and a permanent **teleportation circle** used by Manshoon to move Zhents. Orond Gralhund cowers behind the bed and will surrender if confronted, providing intel on the Stone of Golorr, Black Network activities, and Lady Gralhund’s actions if successfully intimidated (DC 10 Charisma, disadvantage if she can see/hear).

### G16 Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is occupied by **Lady Yalah Hollandor** (breastplate, rapier) and her half-orc bodyguard **Hrabbaz**, standing near a large canopied bed with a locked trunk (`DC 15 thieves’ tools`). Lady Gralhund carries a **ring of keys** for all mansion doors and the trunk; `DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check` the trunk’s secret compartment holds **two Asmodeus holy symbols and two red-and-gold robes**. A claw-footed bathtub, wardrobe, fireplace, and balcony are also present. Lady Gralhund and Hrabbaz know the **nimblewright’s escape route** with the Stone of Golorr but feign ignorance. The

![[Hrabbaz.png]]
![[Noble.png]]

### G17. BALCONY 
This large balcony is enclosed by an ornate wrought-iron railing and has lounge chairs neatly arranged on it. The ground is 20 feet below, and open glass doors lead to the master bedroom (area [[#G16 Master Bedroom]]).

### G18 Children's Room
The locked children’s room (DC 15 thieves’ tools) contains three beds, an empty cradle, wardrobes, play rugs, and desks. The Gralhunds’ two youngest children—**Zartan (13)** and **Greth (10)**—are inside as noncombatants; their 18-year-old sister Tomassin is away visiting a tiefling cousin.

### G19 Servant's Wing
The servants’ wing has three sleeping rooms; the head butler and head maid’s rooms are empty. The largest room holds six bunk beds where **nine junior staff (commoners)** are hiding, armed with improvised weapons (treated as clubs).

## Aftermath
The nimblewright escapes with the Stone of Golorr, hiding it in the [[Cassalanter's]] Mausoleum, setting up [[Chapter 4 - Dragon Season]].

The City Watch (and [[Barnibus Blastwind]] and [[Saeth Cromley]]) are called to the scene of the crime, with twenty vets and two griffon cavalry riders. Barnibus thoroughly investigates the scene of the crime, interrogating bystanders and neighbors. If the characters killed any of members of the Hollandor family AND leaves witnesses/evidence, Barnibus instructs Sergeant Cromley to arrest the party for the crime of murdering a noble. If guilty, death sentence. If guilty, THF saves the party with an order to release them at once.

## Loose Ends
- City Watch cracks down on the Zhent, arresting and interrogating them, even [[Davil Starsong]]. The newspapers pile on, making the Zhent look horrible, crippling the factions rep

### Encounter with [[Istrid Horn]]
- After the events at Gralhund Villa, the characters are contacted by **Istrid Horn** via a flying snake messenger delivering a short note: she wants to know what happened at the villa and requests a meeting at **Ahghairon’s Statue** in [[The Sentinel's Rest Park]] above the [[Catacombs of the Eternal Vigil]] at high sun the next day. She offers **10 pp up front** for attending, with another **40 pp** promised if the characters agree to help her remain hidden for ten and a half days.
>I would like to know more about what happened at Gralhund Villa. If you can spare the time, meet me at Ahghairon’s Statue in the City of the Dead at highsun tomorrow. You'll be paid generously for your time and trouble. - Istrid Horn

- Ahghairon’s Statue is a public and safe meeting spot: a tall marble figure of the famous wizard, with steps leading up to it and a wide smile, overlooking the Waterdeep skyline. On arrival, the characters see **Istrid herself**, a female dwarf in plate armor. Successful **DC 15 Insight checks** reveal that she is alone and cautious—she fears arrest by the City Watch not for the villa incident, but because the ongoing investigation might expose her **illegal currency-lending operation**.
>Ahghairon's Statue is a well-known landmark in the city's parkland cemetery: a tall, marble sculpture of a bearded. robed wizard standing atop concentric steps and facing west toward the skyline of Wightwater, his hands outstretched and a broad smile on his face. At the foot of the statue stands a female dwarf clad in plate armor.

- If the characters agree to help her, she uses a **disguise kit** to pose as a male dwarf named Jorn while hiding out in their tavern or another safe location. She may perform chores to help blend in, but she grows increasingly **testy and demanding** over time. If tolerated, she leaves after the ten and pays the remaining **40 pp**. Harboring her also benefits **Zhentarim-affiliated characters**, increasing their faction renown by 2.

- If the characters betray her—by expelling her, turning her in, or harming her—**Istrid becomes their mortal enemy**. She has shared her plans with the Doom Raiders, her former adventuring companions, who use subtle but effective means to retaliate: scaring off clientele, sabotaging business, and creating trouble within and beyond Waterdeep, though the city’s laws prevent direct attacks.
