## The investigation into the Fireball
### Overview
- [[Dalakhar]], a rock gnome working for [[Dagult Neverember]] is trying to deliver the [[Stone of Golorr]] to party 
	- He was being chased by agents of the (bad) Zhent, including two goons and [[Urstul Floxin]]. The goons were close to getting Dalakhar when the fireball went off, killing the two goons, and severely injuring Urstul, but not keeping him from grabbing the stone, stumbling to [[Gralhund Villa]] a short distance away
		- [[Yalah Hollandor|Yalah]] and [[Orond Hollandor]] are the heads of a minor noble family that has fell from the heights of nobility to the low, and they are working their way back up. To jump-start their climb, they are hoping to use a portion of the hidden cache of gold. They are providing coin and shelter for Urstul and his Zhents for a cut of the dragons
	- They don't trust the Black Network and put some eggs in another basket, that of a *nimblewright*. This construct was to shadow the Zhent and eliminate Dalakhar for them, using a necklace of fireballs given to it by Yalah.
	- The nimblewright escaped from the House of Inspired Hands, the temple of Gond. It hitched a ride on the Gralhund's coach where Yalah befriended it
	- The fireball incident strains the relationship between Urstul and the Gralhunds, with Urstul refusing to give up the Stone of Golorr until he speaks with [[Manshoon]] while the Gralhunds are weighing the risks of betraying and murdering Urstul in his own house
- The players should learn who or what cast the fireball, why the attack was committed, and where the stone was taken. [[Vincent Trench]] can offer information for a fee (10 gp?)
### The crime scene
- People come out to survey the devastation, figure out what happened
- No buildings are on fire, but 11 people died
	- Elderly female human on a walk, no one recognizes
	- Two cloaked male humans (`DC 15 Perception Check` to figure out one has a black, winged snake on his right forearm)
	- Two female humans and one male half-elf (servants of a wealthy family in the [[North Harbor]] running errands)
	- One male gnome wearing a burned cloak and clutching a dagger
	- Two female halflings who were playing a flute and fiddle and two male halflings who were dancing
- The PC's have 1d4 + 2 minutes before the City Guard arrives, where the aren't allowed access to the bodies unless invisible or similarly hidden
	- `DC 15 perception check` for discovering winged serpent and for noticing dry waste on the boots of the gnome, and a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones 
	- `DC 13 Sleight of Hand check` to be unnoticed taking the pouch, if failed the witness will report them to the guard when they arrive, or at least 50gp to silence the witness
### After the blast
- The  characters have a few minutes to examine the crime scene before the City Guard arrive with 6 guards at each entrance (North, Northeast, and West entrances). They don't allow anyone in or out w/o permission from a superior officer. 6 more guards and a sergeant (w/ 18 hp) watch over the dead body until the City Watch arrives. A Griffon Cavalry Rider is attracted and watches for suspicious people while the griffon circles the neighborhood

- 20 minutes later, a sergeant with the City Watch,  [[Saeth Cromley]], arrives with [[Barnibus Blastwind]], from the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]]. who takes charge of the investigation, while Saeth directs 20 veterans to question locals
- Barnibus prefers to keep the following info to himself:
	- Gnome was running from 3 armed pursuers, but the third pursuer isn't among the dead
	- The gnome and his pursuers were moving to [[Pixiedust Manor]]
	- Neither the gnome or the pursuers saw the blast coming
- Barnibus will question the owner's and occupants with Cromley as his witness and bodyguard
- He wants to find out who the gnome was and whether anyone knew him
	- Players shouldn't know him unless they lie
- Both Cromley and Barnibus refuse to join in the search, saying "Trust in the Watch," and "That would introduce too many new variables in an already confounding equation".
- They don't jump to conclusions but by nature of proximity during the blast, the players are suspects. They won't arrest anyone w/o ironclad evidence and reliable eyewitnesses
#### Eyewitnesses
- [[Fala Lefaliir]], owner of [[Corellon's Crown]] says:
	- She saw Urstul w/ the Stone, circling around the [[Bent Nail]]
>"I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn't injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome. then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail."

- Jezrynne Hornraven was leaving the Tiger's Eye having hired Vincent to spy on her philandering husband
	- She saw the nimblewright but didn't see where it went or what it threw to cause the explosion
>"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!"

- Martem Trec, a 12-year-old boy was behind a rain barrel after the explosion went off and watching his friends perish in the flames.
	- He produces a necklace of fireballs w/ two beads on it. The nimblewright accidently yanked it off as it fled, and it slid and dropped into the barrel beside Martem. `DC 8 Intimidation or Persuasion Check` to make Martem give it to them or they can snatch it. Characters who withhold the necklace (and/or the knowledge of it) are guilty of hampering justice by concealing evidence, punishable by a fine of up to 200 gp and hard labor for up to a tenday
>Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a 'plop' and found this in the barrel.
