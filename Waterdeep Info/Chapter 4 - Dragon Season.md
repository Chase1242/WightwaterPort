# Dragon Season
## Finding the nimblewright
If the characters can't pick up the trail after the nimblewright escapes with the Stone of Golorr, they might turn to the City Watch, the City Guard. or a friendly faction for help, which comes forth in ld4 days. If it occurs to none of the characters, an NPC suggests that the party visit the House of Inspired Hands to see whether the priests of Gond know a way to find it (see "Nim's Secret," page 46). Thereafter, armed with Nim's nimblewright detector, the characters can sweep the city. But by the time they find the nimblewright, it has already delivered the Stone of Golorr to its intended destination.

### Caught at last
When it is finally found, the nimblewright is wearing a stolen cloak and hiding under a pile of uncollected garbage in an alley. Exactly where and when the characters stumble upon it is up to you.
With nowhere to go and no other purpose, it fights until destroyed. Regardless of where and when this event takes place, six members of the City Watch (veterans) arrive as the fight ends. Drawn by the commotion, the Watch couldn't care less about the nimblewright and believes any plausible story the characters tell them. (As a construct, it had no rights to speak of.) The officers are near the end of their shift and eager to move on; they urge the characters to go home and cause no further mischief.

### Lady Hollandor's Map
Lady Hollandor gave a map of where to deliver the [[Stone of Golorr]] (the [[Cassalanter's]] mausoleum), but forgot to tell the nimblewright to destroy the map. If the characters search the remains, they find a map with an `X` on it, with the name Cassalanter next to it. The map is of the catacombs of the city ([[Catacombs of the Eternal Vigil]])
#### Obtaining the Stone of Golorr
The Stone of Golorr possesses an intelligent, alien intellect and has enough prescience to realize that the characters are destined to find it. The stone doesn't want to be found too easily, though.

If the characters obtain the stone earlier than expected, it proves uncooperative and tries to separate itself from the party as quickly as possible, refusing to share any knowledge with characters in the meantime. The stone tries to take control of anyone who attunes to it, triggering a conflict (see "Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the stone fails to take control, it can't try again against that character until the next dawn. If the stone succeeds in taking control of its owner, it orders that character to deliver it to whichever location sets into motion the sequence of encounters discussed in this chapter (see "Encounter Chains"). Once the stone divests itself of its current owner, it tries to erase all knowledge of itself from that character's mind (see the item's description in appendix A). Any player whose character is forced to forget about the stone carries the burden of roleplaying that memory loss. You can award inspiration to that character as a way to acknowledge the player's good roleplaying.

As chapter 4 unfolds, you decide when it's time for the characters to have a chance of securing the Stone of Golorr. Try to keep it out of their hands for as long as possible to
maximize the suspense. 

Once the characters have earned the Stone of Golorr, it no longer tries to take control of them. A character can attune to it and learn the following information:
- The location of the Vault of Dragons (see "Vault of Dragons," page 94)
- The three keys required to unlock the vault's doors (see "Vault Keys," page 90)
- The name of the vault's gold dragon guardian, and the powers of the staff in its possession (see the description of the [[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon]] in appendix A)

## Summer Encounter Chain

### Summary
1. [[#4: Mausoleum]]
2. [[#10: Converted Windmill]]
3. [[#5: Rooftop Chase]]
4. [[#1: Alley]]
5. [[#3: Street Chase]]
6. [[#9: Cellar Complex]]
7. [[#8: Courthouse]]
8. [[#7: Old Tower]]

The characters arrive at the Cassalanter mausoleum to find several dead cultists inside (encounter 4, "Mausoleum"). A left-for-dead survivor reveals that these cultists were betrayed by two of their own. The characters head to an old windmill in the Southern Ward where the cult fanatics practice their diabolical faith (encounter 10, "Converted Windmill'"). Spined devils swoop in, snatch the stone, and flee, setting up a rooftop chase (encounter 5, "Rooftop Chase"). 

The spined devils deliver the stone to a hire-coach parked in an alley(encounter 1, "Alley"). Inside the coach is Victoro Cassalanter's valet, Willifort Crowelle, a doppelganger in tiefling form. As the hire-coach flees, a street chase ensues (encounter 3, "Street Chase"). When a crowd cuts off his escape route, Willifort leaps out of the hire-coach and tries to lose himself in the crowd. In the confusion, street urchins snatch the stone. The characters catch up to the children in their cellar hideout (encounter 9, "Cellar Complex"). 

With the Stone of Golorr in their possession, the characters emerge from the cellar complex only to find themselves surrounded by members of the City Watch. They are arrested for one or more crimes and taken to a courthouse in the Dock Ward to face sentencing by a magister (encounter 8,  Courthouse"). Meanwhile, the doppelganger tries to get the stone back. Any character who becomes attuned to the Stone of Golorr learns that the Vault of Dragons is hidden under an old tower in the Sea Ward (encounter 7, "Old Tower"). When they arrive at the tower, they encounter its new owner, who is discussing renovations with various local guild members.

#### Weather effects
Until the encounter chain is complete, the following weather effect is in play. 

**Heat Wave**. During the day, a character without access to drinkable water must succeed on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw at the end of each encounter in the chain or gain one level of exhaustion. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the character is wearing medium or heavy armor. Characters who have resistance or immunity to fire automatically succeed on the saving throw.

### 4: Mausoleum
Rooms in the mausoleum have 8-foot-high ceilings, with 6-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them. The following locations are keyed to map 4.3.
#### M1: Ground Level
The door into the mausoleum is locked, and requires a successful `DC 15 Thieves' Tools` check or `DC 25 Athletics Check`. The [[Cassalanter's|Cassalanter]] family emblem is emblazoned on the floor between 4 coffins. A successful `DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check` reveals that it has been opened recently, as evidenced by dirt smears on the door.
#### M2: Underground Crypts
Three cultists lay on the floor, two dead and one left for dead but unconscious. If Vaelle Lurval (LE, female, Arasian cultist) is healed, she regains consciousness and reveals Arn Xalrondar and Seffia Naelryke would likely have taken it to an old lumber mill, a meeting point in the [[Southlums]], where there are some ceremonies worshipping [[Asmodeus]]. If at or near full health, will offer to come with to avenge her bd, Holiver Tornrudder, or she will offer directions. She believes
