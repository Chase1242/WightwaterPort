# Dragon Season
## Finding the nimblewright
If the characters can't pick up the trail after the nimblewright escapes with the Stone of Golorr, they might turn to the City Watch, the City Guard. or a friendly faction for help, which comes forth in ld4 days. If it occurs to none of the characters, an NPC suggests that the party visit the House of Inspired Hands to see whether the priests of Gond know a way to find it (see "Nim's Secret," page 46). Thereafter, armed with Nim's nimblewright detector, the characters can sweep the city. But by the time they find the nimblewright, it has already delivered the Stone of Golorr to its intended destination.

### Caught at last
When it is finally found, the nimblewright is wearing a stolen cloak and hiding under a pile of uncollected garbage in an alley. Exactly where and when the characters stumble upon it is up to you.
With nowhere to go and no other purpose, it fights until destroyed. Regardless of where and when this event takes place, six members of the City Watch (veterans) arrive as the fight ends. Drawn by the commotion, the Watch couldn't care less about the nimblewright and believes any plausible story the characters tell them. (As a construct, it had no rights to speak of.) The officers are near the end of their shift and eager to move on; they urge the characters to go home and cause no further mischief.

### Lady Hollandor's Map
Lady Hollandor gave a map of where to deliver the [[Stone of Golorr]] (the [[Cassalanter's]] mausoleum), but forgot to tell the nimblewright to destroy the map. If the characters search the remains, they find a map with an `X` on it, with the name Cassalanter next to it. The map is of the catacombs of the city ([[Catacombs of the Eternal Vigil]])
#### Obtaining the Stone of Golorr
The Stone of Golorr possesses an intelligent, alien intellect and has enough prescience to realize that the characters are destined to find it. The stone doesn't want to be found too easily, though.

If the characters obtain the stone earlier than expected, it proves uncooperative and tries to separate itself from the party as quickly as possible, refusing to share any knowledge with characters in the meantime. The stone tries to take control of anyone who attunes to it, triggering a conflict (see "Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the stone fails to take control, it can't try again against that character until the next dawn. If the stone succeeds in taking control of its owner, it orders that character to deliver it to whichever location sets into motion the sequence of encounters discussed in this chapter (see "Encounter Chains"). Once the stone divests itself of its current owner, it tries to erase all knowledge of itself from that character's mind (see the item's description in appendix A). Any player whose character is forced to forget about the stone carries the burden of roleplaying that memory loss. You can award inspiration to that character as a way to acknowledge the player's good roleplaying.

As chapter 4 unfolds, you decide when it's time for the characters to have a chance of securing the Stone of Golorr. Try to keep it out of their hands for as long as possible to
maximize the suspense. 

Once the characters have earned the Stone of Golorr, it no longer tries to take control of them. A character can attune to it and learn the following information:
- The location of the Vault of Dragons (see "Vault of Dragons," page 94)
- The three keys required to unlock the vault's doors (see "Vault Keys," page 90)
- The name of the vault's gold dragon guardian, and the powers of the staff in its possession (see the description of the [[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon]] in appendix A)

## Summer Encounter Chain
If, at any one time, the stone falls into the hands of the Cassalanter's, then you cut to chapter 5, [[#8 Courthouse]] and chapter 5. The Courthouse would just be them getting sentenced most likely to some time for punishments.

Once you go to chapter 5, that is when [[Corwin FibbleWibble]] is kidnapped due to his investigation into the Cassalanter's. However, if the PCs have the [[Stone of Golorr]], they receive a letter letting Xerxes know that they have his dad and he will be sacrificed unless they show up with the stone in a tenday (enough time for a level up/scouting)
### Summary
1. [[#4: Mausoleum]]
2. [[#10: Converted Windmill]]
3. [[#5: Rooftop Chase]]
4. [[#1: Alley]]
5. [[#3: Street Chase]]
6. [[#9: Cellar Complex]]
7. [[#8: Courthouse]]
8. [[#7: Old Tower]]

The characters arrive at the Cassalanter mausoleum to find several dead cultists inside (encounter 4, "Mausoleum"). A left-for-dead survivor reveals that these cultists were betrayed by two of their own. The characters head to an old windmill in the Southern Ward where the cult fanatics practice their diabolical faith (encounter 10, "Converted Windmill'"). Spined devils swoop in, snatch the stone, and flee, setting up a rooftop chase (encounter 5, "Rooftop Chase"). 

The spined devils deliver the stone to a hire-coach parked in an alley(encounter 1, "Alley"). Inside the coach is Victoro Cassalanter's valet, Willifort Crowelle, a doppelganger in tiefling form. As the hire-coach flees, a street chase ensues (encounter 3, "Street Chase"). When a crowd cuts off his escape route, Willifort leaps out of the hire-coach and tries to lose himself in the crowd. In the confusion, street urchins snatch the stone. The characters catch up to the children in their cellar hideout (encounter 9, "Cellar Complex"). 

With the Stone of Golorr in their possession, the characters emerge from the cellar complex only to find themselves surrounded by members of the City Watch. They are arrested for one or more crimes and taken to a courthouse in the Dock Ward to face sentencing by a magister (encounter 8,  Courthouse"). Meanwhile, the doppelganger tries to get the stone back. Any character who becomes attuned to the Stone of Golorr learns that the Vault of Dragons is hidden under an old tower in the Sea Ward (encounter 7, "Old Tower"). When they arrive at the tower, they encounter its new owner, who is discussing renovations with various local guild members.

#### Weather effects
Until the encounter chain is complete, the following weather effect is in play. 

**Heat Wave**. During the day, a character without access to drinkable water must succeed on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw at the end of each encounter in the chain or gain one level of exhaustion. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the character is wearing medium or heavy armor. Characters who have resistance or immunity to fire automatically succeed on the saving throw.

### 4: Mausoleum
Rooms in the mausoleum have 8-foot-high ceilings, with 6-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them. The following locations are keyed to map 4.3.
#### M1: Ground Level
The door into the mausoleum is locked, and requires a successful `DC 15 Thieves' Tools` check or `DC 25 Athletics Check`. The [[Cassalanter's|Cassalanter]] family emblem is emblazoned on the floor between 4 coffins. A successful `DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check` reveals that it has been opened recently, as evidenced by dirt smears on the door.
#### M2: Underground Crypts
Three cultists lay on the floor, two dead and one left for dead but unconscious. If Vaelle Lurval (LE, female, Arasian cultist) is healed, she regains consciousness and reveals Arn Xalrondar and Seffia Naelryke would likely have taken it to an old lumber mill, a meeting point in the [[Southlums]], where there are some ceremonies worshipping [[Asmodeus]]. If at or near full health, will offer to come with to avenge her bd, Holiver Tornrudder, or she will offer directions. She believes
### 10: Converted Windmill
This crumbling, two-story stone building was a windmill long before the city rose up around it. The following features apply unless an area description or encounter states otherwise: 
- Rooms have 15-foot-high ceilings, with 10-foot-high passages and 7-foot-high doorways connecting them. 
- Doors are wooden, closed, and unlocked. • The walls are covered with graffiti, and the stone floors are strewn with garbage and detritus. Windows are empty lead frames without glass. 
- There are no light sources.
![[Converted_Windmill.png]]
#### W1. Stone Staircase
A curved set of stone stairs climbs 20 feet to the upper level. The stairs are covered with bird droppings, broken roof shingles, mud, and mold.
#### W2. Squatters
During the spring, summer, and winter, each of these rooms is home to 4 squatters (commoners) who have made dens for themselves out of old furnishings and things salvaged from garbage piles. The squatters aren't looking for trouble.
For some food or coin, a squatters can direct or lead characters to the locked apartment on the upper level (area [[#W7. Secure Apartment|W7]]) and describe the apartment's inhabitants. A character can also secure a squatter's cooperation with a successful `DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check`.
#### W3. Privy
Beyond the door is nothing more than a hole in the floor from which rises a terrible stench.
#### W4. Weak Ceiling/Floor
Area W4a is directly underneath area W4b. The floor of the upper chamber collapses under the weight of the first Small or larger creature to walk across it. A character who has the Stonecunning trait or proficiency with mason's tools can tell that the floor is unsafe to walk on. 
Any creature standing on the floor of area W4b when it collapses falls 20 feet (3d4 bludgeoning damage), landing in area W4a. Any creature in area W4a when the ceiling falls in must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (ld8) bludgeoning damage from falling debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### W5. Ancient Millstone
An ancient millstone lies under a jumble of debris that includes machinery and pieces of the collapsed roof. Dust and cobwebs cover everything.
#### W6. Pigeon Roosts
Large sections of the roof have caved in above these rooms, leaving holes through which birds and precipitation can enter. The floors are littered with broken shingles. bird droppings, wrecked furnishings. and other detritus, and scores of pigeons roost in the moldy rafters.
#### W7. Secure Apartment
The north door to this room has been fitted with a shiny new lock that can be picked with a successful `DC 15 Dexterity check` using thieves' tools. The door can also be unlocked from inside the room, or forced open with a successful `DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check`. 
This apartment is in good repair and contains the following features: 
- A wood-framed, king-sized bed with clean mattresses stands against one wall. (Next to the bed, an unlocked door in the west wall leads to area [[#W8. Back Room|W8]].) 
- The window was recently repaired and quietly swings open on oiled iron hinges. 
- Across from the window, against the wall, stands a wooden armoire. The armoire holds four clean sets of clothes, two gray cloaks, a heavy crossbow, and a wooden case containing twenty crossbow bolts.
Arn Xalrondar and Seffia Naelryke await inside.
#### W8. Back Room
The section of conical roof directly above this chamber has mostly collapsed. The debris from the collapse has been cleared, and a pentagram in blood with black globs of wax at each point lays in the center of the room.
#### Summer
The characters head to a decrepit building in the Southern Ward that used to be a windmill. Therein, they expect to find the Stone of Golorr in the clutches of two treacherous cult fanatics named Arn Xalrondar (LE male Tethyrian human) and Seffia Naelryke (LE female Arasian human).
#### Cult fanatics
Arn and Seffia are waiting in area W7, which they use as an apartment. They keep the door to the apartment locked at all times. They have cleared area W8 of debris and painted a pentagram in blood on the floor. At the points of the pentagram are five black globs of wax- the remains of burned candles. 
Lord Cassalanter sent Arn and Seffia on a mission to retrieve the [[Stone of Golorr]] from his family's mausoleum. He also gave them secret orders to dispose of three other members of the cult whom he couldn't trust to keep quiet about the stone. Arn and Seffia would be horrified to learn that they failed in so simple a task; they try to correct their mistake by killing Vaelle Lurval if she's with the party (see "Mausoleum: Summer," page 70).
#### Devil's Arrival
As characters try to break into the cult fanatics' apartment, three spined devils arrive. The devils fly to the tower, knock on the apartment window, and are let inside by Seffia, whereupon Arn gives one of them the Stone of Golorr. When the characters enter, they see the devils fly off with the stone. The cult fanatics do everything in their power to enable the devils to escape.
#### Next Encounter
If the characters deal with the cult fanatics, they can chase after the fieeing spined devils by running across rooftops. Proceed with encounter 5, "[[#5 Rooftop Chase]]."
### 5: Rooftop Chase
The characters are trying to catch up with three spined devils that keep low above the rooftops, so as not to be seen by Wightwater's Griffon Cavalry. The devils are 100 feet away from the characters at the start of the chase. 
If the devil carrying the Stone of Golorr becomes incapacitated, another devil snatches the stone and flees with it.
![[Rooftop_Chase_Complications.png]]
#### Next Encounter
When the characters are close to getting the stone, or when you want the chase to end, all remaining spined devils duck into an alley. If the characters lose their quarry, they can question city folk on the ground who saw where the devils went. Continue with encounter 1, "Alley."
### 1: Alley
The buildings that border the alley are 30 feet tall (3 stories). Outdoors.
![[Alley.png]]
#### Areas of the Alley
##### LI. Alley Residence 
This old, one-story, windowless stone house with a slate roof is tucked in the middle of the alley, surrounded by taller buildings. Its doors are made of sturdy wood, and the outer door can be barred shut from within. Breaking down the barred door requires a successful `DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check`. The interior is divided into two rooms, a kitchen with a fireplace and a plainly furnished bedroom.
##### L2. Store
This stone building is a store of one kind or another. 1f an encounter doesn't specify the goods sold here, roll a d20 and consult the Store Goods table to determine what the store sells. A small room serves as a cloakroom, where visitors can hang their heavier overgarments. Past the cloakroom is the store proper, with wares on display. The room to the north is a storeroom or a workshop. The store owner (commoner) has keys to all doors.
#### Summer
The characters begin this encounter on the rooftops overlooking the alley. If any characters went to ground during the rooftop chase, start them at one end of the alley instead.
##### Hire-Coach
Parked in the middle of the alley is a hire-coach pulled by two draft horses. The driver, Haru Hamatori (LG male Thepinan human commoner), wears a feathered cap and matching outfit. 

Lord Cassalanter's doppelganger valet, in the guise of an elderly tiefling named Willifort Crowelle, sits in the passenger cab, which grants half cover. Standing next to the hire-coach is a bearded devil disguised as a cloaked human bodyguard wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and perched on the coach are three invisible imps. Any spined devils that survived the previous encounter are also present, having just delivered the Stone of Golorr to Willifort. 

When he sees the characters, Willifort orders the imps and the spined devils to attack. The bearded devil stays close to Willifort and engages any character who tries to reach the hire-coach.

The hire-coach has AC 14, 45 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If there's any chance that the characters might obtain the Stone of Golorr as the encounter progresses, Willifort orders the driver to move the hire-coach out of the alley as quickly as possible. If the driver is incapacitated or killed, the bearded devil climbs into the driver's seat on the back of the coach and steers the vehicle. If the bearded devil is unable to replace the driver, the doppelganger takes the reins. Willifort flees on foot if the hire-coach is destroyed or its horses are unable to move.

If Willifort escapes and the characters pursue him, go to next encounter
### 3: Street Chase
For this encounter, use the chase rules and the Urban Chase Complications table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The chase plays out as a "theater of the mind" experience. Consequently, you don't need a map to run the encounter. The chase occurs outdoors, so be mindful of any weather effects in play.
![[Urban_chase_complications.png]]
The characters are pursuing Lord Cassalanter's doppelganger valet, Willifort, as he flees in a hire-coach or on foot. The chase takes place on crowded streets, in front of agog spectators. If you haven't been tracking the distance between the doppelganger and the characters, assume the characters are 120 feet away from their quarry at the start of the chase if Willi fort is traveling by hire-coach, or 60 feet away if the doppelganger is on foot. The hire-coach has an initiative modifier of +O, and Willifort moves with it. A creature in the hire-coach doesn't need to roll on the Urban Chase Complications table on its turn.
#### Crowded Street
If Willifort flees in a hire-coach, his getaway is thwarted on the third round of the chase when a large crowd blocks the road, forcing the hire-coach to stop. (If the chase occurs on Founders' Day, the crowd is part of the holiday celebration.) The doppelganger jumps out of the hire-coach on his next turn and makes his way through the crowd on foot.
Any creature in the crowd has half cover, and any attack that misses the creature because of the cover hits an innocent commoner instead. If Willifort is incapacitated, a raven abruptly swoops down, acting next in the initiative count. It snatches the stone and flees with it. This raven is a shape changed imp that works for Lady Cassalanter.
#### Street Urchins
The chase ends when three street urchins (see "The Three Urchins," page 63) steal the stone, either by pickpocketing it from the doppelganger or by shooting a toy arrow at the raven and causing it to drop the stone.

Once they have the stone, the street urchins quickly lose themselves in the crowd. If Willifort the doppelganger is still around, he tries to slip away, believing he still bas the stone. The imp, if present, turns invisible and circles above the crowd in a futile attempt to find the stone.

A character can use an action to search the crowded street by making a `DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check`. On a successful check, the character spots an iron grate in the street that wasn't closed properly. Lifting it reveals an iron ladder that descends 10 feet to an underground sewer tunnel. Characters who lower themselves into the tunnel can hear the sounds of splashing water and children's voices in the distance and might decide to follow them. (The children are holding hands in the dark and being guided by [[Squiddly]], who has darkvision.)
### 9: Cellar Complex
Cellars and sewer tunnels intersect to create small dungeons under Waterdeep. These complexes have the following features: 
- Ceilings and doorways are 7 feet high. 
- There are no light sources.
#### Summer
##### Sickening Smell
The summer heat makes the sewer smell worse than usual, and characters become poisoned by the stench unless they cover their noses with perfumed scarves. The effect lasts until they leave the sewers. The street urchins and other creatures that live in the sewers are accustomed to the smell and aren't poisoned in this way
##### Search for the Urchins
The characters approach the cellar complex from the east, eventually coming upon an iron door in the side of the sewer tunnel (area B4). 
The street urchins took the Stone of Golorr to area 87 {which serves as their clubhouse). entering the room through a secret door (area 83). The eldest child. Nat, attuned to the stone, but contact with the aboleth so terrified her that she dropped it, screamed, and ran away.
The boys were panicked by her reaction and fled as well, leaving the stone in area B7. If the characters open the door at area B4, they startle the children on the other side, causing them to scream at the top of their lungs. Communicating through the other children, Nat tells the characters where she dropped the stone and warns them that it's "alive." Neither she nor the boys are eager to see it again.
##### Chair today, gone tomorrow
If the characters head to area B7, they see the Stone of Golorr underneath a wooden rocking chair. If the street urchins are present, one of them asks, "Where'd that rocking chair come from?" The rocking chair is the mimic from area B9b. It heard the urchins' screams and investigated, hoping to snare an easy meal. It attacks anyone who harms it or reaches for the stone.
#### Areas of the Cellar Complex
The following locations are keyed to map 4.7. The complex has three distinct sections: the sewer tunnels (areas Bl-B3), the southern cellars (areas 84-89), and the northern cellars (areas B10- B11).
![[Cellar_complex.png]]
##### B1. Sewer Access
This chamber has stone steps and a locked, iron-bound wooden door with a sign mounted on it that reads, in Common, "SEWER ACCESS: AUTHORIZED CITY OFFICIALS ONLY." The door to area B2 is locked. The lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful `DC 17 Dexterity check` using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful `DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check`. City Watch captains hold keys to sewer access points that correspond with their assigned wards.

##### B2. Sewers
The sewage is 3 feet deep. Any creature immersed in it for 1 minute must succeed on a `DC 11 Constitution saving throw` or become infected with sewer plague (sec "Diseases" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
##### B3. Secret Doors
One door opens into B7, the other into B10. Passive perception 15 spots both doors as you walk by. ==No PCs have higher than 15 PP.==
##### B4. Rusty Iron Door
Unlocked, door squeals loudly on rusted hinges when opened.
##### B5. Arrow Slits
A brick wall with arrow slits was added to this room at some point. The arrow slits are designed to allow archers to fire at intruders who come through the door at area B4. The arrow slits provide three-quarters cover.
##### B8. Sunken Cellar
This sunken cellar has these features: 
- An unlocked iron door is set into the east wall. 
- A crumbling stone staircase against the south wall climbs up to a landing, where a wooden door is held shut with a chain and a padlock. 
**Iron Door**. The door opens into a small, empty storage room with hooks hanging from the ceiling. 
**Stairs Up**. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. It opens into an alley behind a boarded-up tenement.
##### B9. Rat-infested Cellar
These rooms are situated below a hostel . Harmless rats crawl about, minding their own business. 

B9a. Stone stairs climb 10 feet to a wooden door that opens into a street or alley. Crates and barrels stacked at the bottom of the stairs hold edible foodstuffs, but nothing else of value. 

B9b. A plain wooden door opens into a room containing dusty furnishings in storage. The furniture includes a scratched wooden desk, several wobbly chairs, a coat rack, two small tables, and an empty wooden trunk. There's a 25 percent chance that one piece of furniture (determined randomly) is a mimic that usually feeds on rats but never passes up a bigger meal.

#### Emerging from the sewers
The party emerges from the cellars, to a guard of a dozen City Watch members (veterans), a Watch Sergeant, and eleven constables, who arrest them for disturbing the peace (running across rooftops, whatever else). They demand the characters surrender their weapons and come along quietly.
### 8: Courthouse
![[Courthouse.png]]
People who are arrested by the City Watch are brought to a courthouse and detained until a magister can pass judgment on them. Each courthouse has the following features: 
- Two guards stand outside each of the front and back doors (leading to areas Hl and H6) at all hours. 
- Rooms have 10-foot-high ceilings, with 8-foot-high passages and 7-foot-high doorways connecting them.
- Windows are fitted with iron bars that require a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to bend. 
- Doors are made of iron-bound oak and unlocked. 
- All areas are brightly lit by continual flame spells cast on wall sconces. 
- Cisterns on the roof collect rainwater, which is funneled by pipes down to the showers (area H7).
#### Areas of the Courthouse
##### H1. Upstairs Waiting Room
This room has the following features: 
- Two guards stand outside the doors to the records rooms (area H2) at all hours. Behind a desk sits a court clerk (commoner). 
- Uncomfortable wood benches line the walls. A copper plaque mounted above each bench says, in Common, "Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly." Two privies are situated in a corner by the entrance. 
**Clerk**. The clerk asks visitors what their business is and either directs them to the appropriate area of the courthouse or instructs them to wait. The clerk holds a key to the records rooms (area H2).
##### H2. Records Rooms
Door is locked. Every available inch lined with organized, dated records of court procedures and whatnot.
##### H3. Clerks' Office
Two clerks work at the two desks in the middle, supporting the magister on duty. Both hold a key to H2.
##### H4. Magister's Office
This grand office contains several plush armchairs and a large walnut desk. The seal of Wightwater is emblazoned on the wood floor. When not overseeing a trial, a magister on duty at the courthouse reviews cases and holds meetings here. If a magister is here, so is a knight who serves as a bodyguard.
##### H5. Courtroom
This room has the following features: 
- Two guards are stationed here at all times. 
- If court is in session, the magister is here along with a bodyguard (see area H4) and anyone else pertinent to the case being tried. 
- A magister's cloth-draped desk faces a defendant's box and three rows of pews. 
- Hanging on the west wall are tasseled banners depicting the coats of arms of the City of Wightwater, the Wightwater City Watch, and the Wightwater City Guard, as well as the seal of the Lords of Wightwater and the symbol of Tyr, god of justice.
##### H6. Downstairs Waiting Room
Nobles scheduled to testify in court and those waiting to visit prisoners are held here. The room contains the following features: 
- Two guards are on duty in this room at all times. 
- Mismatched couches line the walls. 
- Old broadsheets rest in loose piles atop end tables.
##### H7. Showers
Dirty prisoners are stripped and washed here before being locked in cells. A chain outside sprays cold water out of the iron faucets.
##### H8. Cell Block
Two guards are stationed in this hall at all times. 
**Locked Cells**. Five cells are spaced along this hall. The door to each cell is locked from the outside, and the guards stationed here hold the keys. A door's lock can't be picked from inside the cell.
##### H9. Watch Wagon
This room contains the following features: 
- Two veterans, members of the City Watch, are here at all times. 
- An armored carriage stands behind a pair of steel doors secured by an iron bar.
**Armored Carriage**. Two horses are needed to pull the carriage, which can hold up to eight Medium prisoners at a time. The back door to the carriage is secured with chains and two padlocks. Each veteran on duty has a key that opens one of the padlocks. 
**Barred Outer Doors**. It takes two people to lift the bar that obstructs the doors to the outside. A successful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check enables one person to do it alone.

#### Summer
##### Under arrest
The arresting force consists of twelve veterans, a Watch sergeant and eleven constables. They demand that the characters surrender their weapons and come along quietly. For guidance on how to handle character arrests, see "Breaking the Law," page 10. 

The characters are charged with disturbing the peace, a minor offense that carries a fine and results in an edict. The charge stems from their conduct in encounter 3, "Street Chase." Depending on how they comported themselves in previous encounters, the characters might be charged with additional crimes against the city or its citizens, possibly including brandishing weapons without due cause, robbery, assaulting a citizen, or murder. If they resist arrest, they are charged with hampering justice. See the Code Legal handout in appendix C for the penalties associated with such crimes. 

Characters who give up their visible weapons without a fuss aren't searched, but those who give the Watch a hard time are searched for hidden weapons (and stripped of anything that could potentially cause harm). A character can conceal a Tiny object from the Watch with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the Stone of Golorr is found during a search, the Watch sergeant inspects it, concludes that it's nothing of consequence, and returns it to its owner.
##### Courthouse
Arrested characters are brought to a courthouse in the Dock Ward and confined to cells (area H8) until their trial. Any items taken from them during their arrest are entrusted to the front desk clerk (area Hl) pending the trial's outcome. A character can take a short rest while incarcerated and use that time to attune to the Stone of Golorr. After ld6 hours, word comes down that the magister is prepared to hear the characters' testimony, whereupon the guards in area H8 unlock the characters' cells and escort them to the courtroom (area H5), where the magister is waiting.
##### False Captain
==If the doppelganger is still at large, does this section. Otherwise, skip it==
If Lord Cassalanter's doppelganger valet is still at large, it kills a Watch captain and uses the victim's uniform to impersonate another Watch captain the characters have met before. Then, in the guise of [[Hyustus Staget]] (see "The Watch Arrives," page 27), the doppelganger kills the guards in area H8 with its bare hands and uses their keys to open the characters' cells. "Hyustus" warns them that the magister is corrupt and suggests they flee the city before they're sentenced to death. "Hyustus" offers to deliver messages or items of import on their behalf while they make good their escape. The doppelganger is hoping that the characters will entrust the Stone of Golorr to it for safekeeping. Failing that, it hopes to wrest the stone from them during the chaos of the jailbreak. 

If the characters refuse to play along, the doppelganger cries out in alarm, bringing the full weight of the courthouse garrison (ten guards and two veterans) down upon the characters, whom "Hyustus" accuses of beating the cell block guards to death. These reinforcements have no reason to believe that Captain Staget isn't who he appears to be, and they side with him in any conflict. 

If the doppelganger obtains the Stone of Golorr, it promptly delivers it to Victoro Cassalanter. If the characters extricate themselves from the mess they're in, they can retrieve the stone from Cassalanter Villa (see chapter 6).
##### Meeting with the Magister
The presiding magister is [[Umbero Zastro]], a handsome, eloquent, and fair-minded half-elf in his thirties. He's known for his finely honed sense of poetic justice and for meting out unconventional punishments. 

Magister Umbero Zastro has the statistics of a noble, with these changes: 
- He is lawful neutral. 
- He is unarmed, unarmored (AC 11), and worth 0 XP. 
- He has these racial traits: He has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep. He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Elvish. 
The magister bas already heard the testimony of the arresting officers, as well as that of any eyewitnesses. The characters are given an hour to plead their case while he asks questions. A character who tries to deceive Zastro must make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the magister's Wisdom (Insight) check. A character who loses this contest is found guilty of hampering justice, locked up for a tenday. and fined 200 gp, on top of any other punishments meted out for crimes committed against the city and its citizenry. Those who can't or won't pay the fine are sentenced to hard labor for a year in Amendsfarm, a City Guard-run labor camp among the farms of Undercliff. 

If the characters committed one or more crimes, they are judged guilty and punished accordingly (see the Code Lega l handout in appendix C). A character who pleads for leniency and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check receives an alternate punishment for crimes that don't carry punishments of death or exile. This check is made with advantage if the character has renown in a respectable faction. such as Force Grey (the Gray Hands), the Emerald Enclave, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance. or the Order of the Gauntlet. Alternate punishments for lesser crimes include the following:
- The character must make beds and clean bedsheets at local orphanages for a tenday, under guard supervision. 
- The character must report to Morana Huldark, a dwarf member of the Guild of Watermen, and scrape barnacles off the docks for a tenday under her close supervision. 
- The character must spend the next month delivering 30-pound casks of drinking water to the guards stationed atop the city walls. 
- For a tenday, the character must stand on a particular street corner every afternoon from highsun to dusk and, like a broadcrier, shout out the crimes of which he or she has been found guilty while accepting the scoldings and verbal lashings of the citizenry.

Characters who are tricked into acting in accordance with the wishes of the doppelganger can be forgiven for crimes committed during the jailbreak, but only if the doppelganger is apprehended or killed. (It reverts to its true form when it dies.) *Speak with dead* spells can be cast on the cell block guards slain by the doppelganger to obtain testimony
#### Next encounter
If a character becomes attuned to the Stone of Golorr. it reveals the location of the [[Vault of Dragons]], beneath an old tower in the [[Sea Ward]], and the three keys needed to enter it. When the characters are ready to visit the location, proceed with encounter 7, '"Old Tower."
### 7: Old Tower
![[Old_tower.png]]
#### Areas of the Old Tower
##### O1. Vestibule
The outer door has a tiny peephole with a closed iron shutter on the inside. Rotting tapestries adorn the walls, and mud and dirt have accumulated on the floor.

Four guards that wear the livery of House Rosznar stand guard here.
##### O2. Ground Level
Stone spiral stairs curl up into the tower, and down into the cellar. A burned heap that used to be a chair sits next to a blackened with soot fireplace.
##### O3. Upper Level
This room, formerly a wizard's laboratory, contains the following features: 
- A soot-stained fireplace has a lidless iron cauldron hanging on an iron hook in its hearth and a wizard's portrait on the wall above the mantelpiece. 
- The floor is littered with shards of broken glass, burned scraps of paper. twisted pieces of metal, and bird droppings. 
- Other furnishings include a rocking chair, a trellis table, and the charred remains of a bookshelf, all shrouded in thick cobwebs. 
- Arrow slits line the walls, and pigeons nest in the rafters.

**Arrow Slits**. Each arrow slit is 4 feet tall and l foot wide-big enough for a Small character or a slim Medium character to squeeze through. 
**Treasure**. A thorough search of the room yields a random treasure, determined by rolling a d4 and consulting the Old Tower Treasure table.
A potion of healing mixed with a potion of flying (if this mixture is imbibed, roll on the Potion Miscibility table in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the effect)
![[potion_miscibility.png]]
##### O4. Cellar
This room contains the following features: 
- A small, circular wooden table is surrounded by four stools made from empty barrels. A marked deck of playing cards is scattered atop the table, with a few stray cards lying on the floor.
- Three crates are stacked against the south wall. Each contains a twenty-day supply of edible rations. 
- Set into the north wall is a sturdy oak door with iron fittings and a built-in lock. 
**Locked Door**. The door to area 05 is locked. The lock can be picked by a character who uses thieves' tools and makes a successful `DC 20 Dexterity check`. The door can also be forced open with a successful `DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check`.
##### O5. Teleportation Circle
Arcane runes are inscribed in a circle on the floor of this otherwise empty chamber. The circle is a permanent teleportation circle (see the teleportation circle spell description in the Player's Handbook).

#### Summer
The old tower, formerly owned by a wizard, was recently bought by [[Esvele Rosznar]], a young noblewoman with a fascinating alter ego (see "The Black Viper" in appendix B).

##### Bought and Paid for
Through her network of spies, Esvele learned about Lord Neverember's friendship with the tower's previous owner. Not long thereafter, she found the entrance to the Vault of Dragons beneath the tower. Unfortunately for her, she doesn't know what keys are needed to enter it or what lies within. When the characters arrive, Esvele is in area 02, meeting with the following three guild representatives (commoners): 
- Sembra Vashir (LN female Calishite human), of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild 
- Pynt Oomtrowl (CG female rock gnome), of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild 
- Jarbokken Frostbeard (LG male shield dwarf), of the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters, and Tile-makers 
This meeting is a formality. As the new owner, Esvele is required by law to bring the building up to code. She is gathering cost estimates from the guilds involved but has no intention of proceeding with repairs. The arrival of the characters provides her with a welcome distraction.

Characters will have a tough time convincing Esvele that they have come for any reason other than to break into the Vault of Dragons. Esvele is willing to bring them on as business partners, allowing them access to the vault (preferably when there aren't guild representatives around) in exchange for an equal share of whatever treasure it might contain. She and the characters have each other over a barrel. She can't have them arrested for burglary without the authorities discovering the vault and seizing the tower. And they can't afford to deny the noblewoman what she wants, lest she divulge the vault's location to the authorities in exchange for a reward. 

Esvele offers to help the characters obtain the keys needed to unlock the Vault of Dragons and insists on accompanying them during their first foray into the vault, claiming all the while that she's capable of looking after herself. However this business with the party unfolds, she tries to conceal her secret identity from the characters for as long as possible. Esvele doesn't use a key to lock and unlock the door to area 05. She uses thieves' tools instead.

##### Path to the Vault
The entrance to the vault is hidden behind a secret door in the north wall of area 05. The secret door was crafted by skilled dwarf engineers and requires a successful `DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check` to locate. Esvele has already disarmed a magic trap on the door, rendering it safe to open. Beyond it lies a dusty staircase that descends 90 feet to a 20-foot-wide corridor. The hall extends another 90 feet to the vault doors. To one side of the vault doors. a natural fissure in the wall once served as a grick's lair, but Esvele killed the grick and left its corpse on the floor.

## Vault Keys
At the end of an encounter chain, a character who is attuned to the Stone of Golorr can learn the location of the Vault of Dragons and what three keys are needed to open its doors. The artifact also reveals that an adult gold dragon named [[Aurinax]] guards the vault. 

The three keys needed to open the vault are chosen by you or determined randomly by rolling on the Vault Keys table. Illusory versions of keys don't open the door. 

Every key can be found or procured in Wightwater. If the characters don't already know the location of a key, they can gather information about it. To do this, a character must spend 1 day and 5 gp researching the location of a key. At the end of this day, the character makes a `DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check`, learning the location of the key on a success. If the check fails by 5 or more, the main villain learns of the search and sends lackeys to attack the characters and, if possible, wrest the Stone of Golorr from them:
![[Vault_Keys.png]]

### Performance of "Your Beardy Face" 
The dwarf love song, ''Your Beardy Face," is a duet performed by bagpipers. The characters can obtain this music easily for 1 gp and hire two performers to play the piece for 10 gp each. A character who has proficiency with bagpipes can perform the song, though a successful DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check using bagpipes is required for the performance to count as this key. A glass jar in Cassalanter Villa (see chapter 6, area C3) plays this song when it is uncorked.
#### Bronze dragon scale
Zelifarn, a young bronze dragon, has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. Many sailors and dock workers have seen the dragon, and Grinda Garlotb owns an *apparatus of Kwalish* that characters can use to search for the dragon. Characters who go looking for Zelifarn find him lurking inside a shipwreck 120 feet underwater. As the characters approach the wreck, Zelifarn comes out and tries to scare them away. (He's not done searching the wreck for treasure.) He inflicts harm only in self-defense. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or an offer of treasure worth at least 1,000 gp convinces the dragon to talk with the characters and part with one of his scales. If the characters mention the contents of the Vault of Dragons, Zelifarn demands a promise of 10 percent of the gold before he gives them what they came for.

### Oracle's Consult Mushroom
This mushroom is somewhat rare, growing only in temperate rainforest climates, and only in abandoned bird nests in the forests, during the summer months after a heavy rain. The mushroom glows a shifting blue-green

## Vault of Dragons
==Come back to this section if/when the adventurers get there (in this chapter or the next)==
All areas of the vault have the following features: 
- Any spell that tries to contact a creature in the vault fails, as does any spell that attempts to scry on the vault interior or any creatures within. Teleporting into the vault from outside is impossible. 
- Walls are made of mortared stone. Doors are solid stone slabs with stone handles and hinges. 
- Except in area V9, there are no light sources.
![[Vault_of_Dragons.png]]
### V1. Vault Door
A 20-foot-high, 20-foot-wide stone corridor ends before an adamantine double door bearing Dwarvish runes. The doors have neither handles nor hinges. The writing on them reads, "THE THREE KEYS. BRING THEM FORTH." 

The doors part, sliding back into the walls, when the three correct keys are brought with 5 feet of them. They remain open until Aurinax or someone else speaks the command word to close them ("Azaam"). The keys can open the doors from either side. The doors can't be forced open or damaged in any way, and attempts to circumvent them with magic fail automatically.
### V2. Entrance Foyer
This vast chamber has the following features: 
- Three age-worn columns support crumbling stone bridges 60 feet overhead, with the ceiling rising another 20 feet beyond that. 
- Set into alcoves are twelve sets of double doors made of iron. Each door is 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and embossed with images of dwarf warriors in plate armor. 
**Crumbling Bridges**. The bridges connect area V4 to adamantine doors that seal off areas V6, V7, and V8. The eastern half of the northern bridge and the western half of the southern bridge are unstable. Either bridge collapses if more than 150 pounds of weight is applied to it. A creature standing on a section of bridge when it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet to the floor below. The middle bridge has a 15-foot-wide gap in it. A character can clear this gap with a running jump-but part of the bridge breaks away under the character's feet on landing, forcing the character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the floor below. 

**Iron Doors**. Ten of the double doors are false and refuse to budge. The two sets of doors at the northern end of the west wall push open to reveal area V3 beyond.

### V3. Stairs and Fresco
This hall has the following features: 
- At the south end of this chamber, expertly carved stairs climb 70 feet to area V4. 
- The north wall bears a 20-foot-square fresco that depicts dwarves battling goblins. 
**Enthralling Fresco**. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic on the fresco. Any creature within 30 feet of the fresco that can see it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by it for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature can't willingly move out of sight of the fresco and defends it to the death. If forcibly moved away from the fresco. the creature tries to find its way back. The creature can't rest while under this effect. After 24 hours, the creature gains one level of exhaustion and can repeat the saving throw if it can still see the fresco, ending the effect on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the effect of the fresco for 24 hours. Destroying at least one 10-foot-square section of the fresco ends the effect for all creatures. Each 10-footsquare section has AC 17, 25 hit points. and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
### V4. Hall of Moradin
This 20-foot-high hall has the following features: 
- Three pillars running the length of the hall are carved to resemble warhammers, with their square heads pressed against the floor . 
- The west wall bears a cracked mosaic that depicts a dwarf smith at a forge, crafting dwarves out of black metal and diamonds. (In the south end of the wall is a secret door.) 
- Three archways in the east wall lead to crumbling bridges that span the entrance foyer (area V2) and end in front of adamantine doors (leading to areas V6. V7, and V8). 
**Black Pudding**. A little more than halfway down the hall. a section of the western mural has broken off, forming a heap of shattered tile on the floor. A crack in the wall conceals a black pudding that gushes out and attacks characters who inspect the damage. 

**Secret Door**. A character who searches the hall for secret doors and succeeds on a `DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check` notices the outline of a secret door that leads to area V5. The door opens automatically when a dwarf (or a creature transformed into a dwarf with an alter self spell or similar magic) touches it; otherwise, a successful `DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check` is needed to push open the heavy door.
### V5. Secret Room
This dust-filled room has lain untouched for a long time. Green copper urns on platforms overflow with coins, gems, and more. 

**Treasure**. This room holds five copper urns (worth 25 gp each). Urn 1 contains five tourmalines (worth 100 gp each) mixed in with 200 cp. Urn 2 contains a ring of warmth mixed in with ten ordinary gold rings (worth 25 gp each) and 650 sp. Urn 3 is piled high with 250 gp. Urn 4 holds 33 blue quartz gemstones (worth 10 gp each). Urn 5 holds a 9-inch-tall silver statuette of a dwarf priest of Moradin with amethyst eyes (worth 250 gp and weighing 10 pounds).

### V6. Hammer and Anvil
The adamantine door to this room has an arcane lock spell cast on it, but it swings open when a dwarf or a creature transformed into a dwarf touches it. Another creature can force it open with a successful `DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check`. A knock spell or similar magic also opens it. The door swings into the room on stiff adamantine hinges. 
- The north, east, and south walls of this 20-foot-high room are adorned with dust-covered frescoes depicting dwarf smiths at work in their forges. 
- An iron anvil sits atop a raised stone block in the middle of the floor. Both fixtures are draped in cobwebs. 
**Frescoes**. A character who inspects the wall frescoes and succeeds on a `DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check` notices that the stone hammer being wielded by the smith in the fresco on the south wall can be taken away from where it rests. When removed, it leaves a hammer-shaped indentation in the wall. Etched into the side of the hammer that was facing the wall is the following inscription in Dwarvish runes: "Let hearts be lifted and battles won." The hammer must be removed from its indentation for the inscription to be seen. 

**Iron Anvil**. If the characters clear away the cobwebs, they see an inscription on the front of the stone block. Written in Dwarvish runes, it reads as follows: "Let the hammer fall and the anvil ring." If the anvil is struck by the stone hammer that was taken from the wall, each creature in the room that can hear the anvil ring gains 10 temporary hit points that last for 24 hours. Once the anvil has bestowed this gift, it can't do so again for 24 hours.
### V7. Dumathoin's Secret
This room is sealed by an adamantine door similar to the one in area V6. The room contains the following features: 
- Four suits of rusted plate armor sans helmets, sized for a dwarf, stand in the corners of this 20-foot-high room. Each suit is draped in cobwebs. 
- - Dwarvish runes are carved into the far wall. The inscription reads, "A secret never before told will part Dumathoin's lips." 
A successful `DC 14 Intelligence (Religion) check` identifies Dumathoin as the dwarven god of secrets. Any dwarf character automatically knows this.

**Secret Stair**. The engraving on the wall is a clue that this room holds a secret, specifically a trapdoor so well hidden that it can't be found by using magic or searching. But when any creature in the room speaks aloud a secret, the trapdoor flips open, giving access to a spiral stone staircase that descends 120 feet to area V9. The spoken admission must be true, and it must be something the character has not previously revealed.

### V8. Ol' Fire Eyes
This room has the following features: 
- A 10-foot-tall painted statue of an armored male dwarf wielding a battleaxe and wearing a mask stands at the back of this 20-foot-high room. 
- Before the statue, set into the floor, is an adamantine trapdoor with a pull ring along one side. 
**Trap**. A successful `DC 17 Intelligence (Religion) check` enables a character to recognize the statue as a depiction of Gorm Gulthyn, the dwarven god of vigilance also known as Fire Eyes. The statue melds seamlessly with the floor and can't be toppled. It also seems impervious to damage. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of evocation magic on the statue. The trapdoor is false and can't be lifted. Anyone who touches the trapdoor or its pull ring must succeed on a `DC 18 Dexterity saving throw` or be struck by rays of magical fire that spring from the statue's eyes, dealing 22 (4d10) fire damage. The trap doesn't trigger if the target has total cover.
### V9. Main Vault
When the characters arrive here for the first time, read:
> Although deep underground, this vault is lit by streams of sunlight that pour down from the ceiling, catching motes of dust in their luminous pools. Ornate columns support a thirty foot-high vaulted ceiling, which is adorned with carvings of dwarves basking in the presence of their gods. Deep alcoves line the walls, and piled in one of them is a vast golden trove. 
> Out of the dusty gloom steps an aged dwarf clutching a staff carved and painted to resemble a pair of entwined dragons-one red, one gold. Despite the dwarfs age, his eyes are steady and bright. "I wasn't expecting anyone," he says plainly. "As you can see, the place is a mess. Perhaps you should come back later, after I've tidied up a bit."

The dwarf, who calls himself Barok Clanghammer, is really the adult gold dragon Aurinax (see appendix B) in disguise. He guards the gold for Lord Dagult Neverember and holds the [[dragonstaff of Ahghairon]] (see appendix A) in exchange for his services. Dealing with the gold dragon presents an unusual challenge for the characters, and a peaceful resolution is more likely to benefit them than a violent one.

Aurinax is patient, wise, merciful, and vigilant. He remains in humanoid form until combat breaks out, since he can't easily carry the dragonstaff of Ahghairon in dragon form. The dragon attacks only in defense of itself, the staff, or the gold. The only individuals authorized to remove the gold under Aurinax's watch are Dagult Neverember and his appointed vassals, none of whom are currently in Wightwater. 

The characters can try to convince Aurinax that they have come on Neverember's behalf. Since he has never met them before or heard Neverember mention them by name, Aurinax is doubtful of their story. Fooling the dragon requires each character within his line of sight to succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the dragon's Wisdom (Insight) check. If even one character loses the contest, Aurinax senses that the group is lying to him. These checks are made with advantage if Renaer Neverember is with the party, since the dragon remembers meeting Renaer when he was but a child and can easily imagine a scenario in which Dagult Neverember might use his son as his vassal. (The dragon knows nothing of the animosity between Renaer and his father.) 

The characters can try to convince the noble dragon that Lord Neverember embezzled the gold from the people of Wightwater, and that it would be fair and just to see the coin safely returned to its rightful owners. Deep down, Aurinax knows where the gold came from, but the dragon has allowed his greed and his agreement with Lord Neverember to cloud his moral judgment. With a successful `DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check`, a character can talk the dragon into allowing the gold to be returned to the people to whom it rightfully belongs. The check is made with advantage if the characters brought a prominent city official with them, such as Mirt or Vajra Safahr, or if one of the characters professes to be a worshiper of Bahamut. 

Any Charisma (Intimidation) check made to influence Aurinax automatically fails. After the first such attempt, all future Charisma checks made by the party to influence Aurinax have disadvantage. Aurinax uses Legendary Resistance to avoid being charmed. If a character tries to charm him with a spell and fails, all future Charisma checks made by the party to influence Aurinax have disadvantage. 

**Treasure**. Choose two alcoves in the vault. Piled in one alcove are 500,000 gp, the combined weight of which is 10,000 pounds. Scattered on the floor of the second alcove are sixty-five 100 gp gemstones-all that remains of Aurinax's current food supply. Aurinax won't give up his gemstones or the dragonstaff of Ahghairon willingly, since they are his payment for guarding the gold. If need be, however, the dragon is willing to use the staff's power on behalf of the city in exchange for more gemstones.
### Leaving the Vault
As the characters leave the vault, with or without the gold, they are confronted by a hostile force sent by the main villain or villains. If the vault doors were left open, the characters encounter these antagonists in area V2; otherwise, they're lurking outside the vault, waiting for the characters to emerge: 

The [[Cassalanter's]] send three cult fanatics and three cultists. Victoro's doppelganger manservant, Willifort Crowelle, leads the group in his tiefling guise unless the characters killed him or otherwise disposed of him earlier in this chapter or in chapter 6. They are waiting in area [[#V2. Entrance Foyer]] if the door was left open, and outside o.w.

#### Faction reinforcement
**Harpers**. [[Mirt]] (see appendix B) arrives with two female human swashbucklers (see appendix B). If he's still alive and not already with the characters, [[Renaer Neverember]] (see appendix B) replaces one of the swashbucklers.
**[[Zhentarim]]**. The Doom Raiders (see appendix B) arrive to help secure the vault, less any members who have been arrested or killed. If they and the characters emerge victorious. the surviving Doom Raiders propose to split the take evenly with the characters. If the characters refuse this offer and the Doom Raiders outnumber them, the Zhents turn against them. putting characters who are Zhentarim members in a predicament.

## Adventure Conclusion
### Dying in the Vault
If the characters die in the Vault of Dragons with the Stone ofGolorr and the main villain doesn't know the vault's location, the secrets of the vault die with them. Though they succumbed in the process, they succeeded in keeping the gold out of the villain's clutches- a bittersweet victory, indeed.

### Removing the Gold
If the characters recover Neverember's hoard and keep it for themselves, word gets out eventually. 

Emissaries of the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, and the Order of the Gauntlet come to the characters, asking that the gold be returned to Wightwater. If the characters refuse to give it up, they are stripped of any memberships they might hold in these factions and quickly find themselves in political hot water. The Lords of Wightwater charge them with the crime of robbery against the citizens of the city. The characters face up to 1 month of hard labor plus damages equal to the value of the stolen currency plus 500 gp. If they try to flee the city, the City Guard apprehends and imprisons them. If they somehow evade the local authorities, the Harpers and agents of the Lords' Alliance pursue them tirelessly.

[[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]] is prepared to let the characters keep 1/10 of the treasure (50,000 gp) for themselves. Even that much coin brings unwanted attention.

## End of the chapter
The characters likely won't be able to get into the vault.
