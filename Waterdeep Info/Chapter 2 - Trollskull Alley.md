## Spirit on tap
- The former tavern is haunted by the poltergeist (**specter**) of the tavern's previous barkeeper, a half-elf named Lif. Maintaining the tavern was his life's work. and he couldn't abandon the place in death.
- The poltergeist understands Common and Elvish, but it can't speak. It invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don't take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as "Closing time!" and "Last call!") on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.
- **Appeasing Lif**. If the characters work to repair and renovate the tavern with the goal of opening it to the public again, the poltergeist begins to accept them as the new owners and gradually becomes quite accommodating: pulling out a chair when a character wants to sit down, pouring a beer and delivering it to a character, taking coats when folks come in from the rain, and so forth. Once the business is up and running, Lif can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.
- **Destroying Lif**. Lif's poltergeist is destroyed if its hit points are reduced to 0. If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the turret when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.
## Organization missions
### [[Emerald Enclave]] mission
- "Outlying farms are being terrorized by a scarecrow come to life. It has slaughtered live-stock, chased horses, and spooked farmers. No people have been killed as yet, so the City Guard is  dragging its heels. Something must be done!"
- Not one but three **scarecrows** are terrorizing outside of the [[Fresh Market]]. One wears a sackcloth hood, another has a rotting pumpkin head, and the third is covered with a threadbare blanket. Characters who camp in a field for the better part of a day or night have a 10 percent chance of encountering one of the scarecrows. The attacks continue until all three scarecrows are destroyed. Reward: Each Emerald Enclave character gains l renown for ending the threat, as well as 20 gp.
#### The Enclave contact
- [[Melannor Fellbranch]]
- The characters' main contact in the Emerald Enclave is Melannor Fellbranch, the friendly but humorless groundskeeper of [[Phaulkonmere]], a compound located one block south of [[Kolat Towers]] (see chapter 8). Phaulkonmere is owned by the Tarm and Phaulkon noble families. Melannor delivers missions by way of animal messenger spells and is partial to using cats and pigeons as couriers. He quickly assigns new members their first mission.
- The Emerald Enclave takes an interest in characters who seek to preserve the balance within Waterdeep (particularly clerics of nature, druids, and rangers). Any such character is visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:  
> Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere near [[Oria Castle]] and the [[Amberwood Gate]]. 
- The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal messenger spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.
##### [[Jeryth Phaulkon]]
- When the characters arrive at Phaulkonmere for the first time, Melannor introduces them to the lady of the estate: a noblewoman-turned-demigod and Chosen of [[King of Wolves and Beasts|Kinghunter]] and Mielikki named Jeryth Phaulkon. Jeryth, the only member of her family who currently resides at Phaulkonmere, manifests as a disembodied female voice that can be heard by anyone in the villa gardens. She offers membership in the enclave and bestows on each new member a [charm of restoration](https://2014.5e.tools/rewards.html#charm%20of%20restoration_dmg) (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Jeryth also offers Phaulkonmere as a safe haven for enclave members and their friends. In her disembodied state, Jeryth can't be harmed. If the need arises, Jeryth can cast any spell on the druid spell list. She uses her spells in defense of her estate and its beautiful gardens. A member of the Emerald Enclave can petition Jeryth to cast a spell, which she is happy to do if that character's renown in the enclave equals or exceeds the spell's level.
### [[Force Grey]] mission
- "Seek out Hlam, a monk who lives in a cave in the [[Cliffs of Oria]]. Ask him what he's heard about threats to the city, but try not to annoy him or overstay your welcome."
- Those who climb the mountainside to reach the cave must succeed on a `DC 12 Constitution saving throw` or arrive with 1d4 levels of exhaustion. Trying to get Hlam (see appendix B) to share information requires a `DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check`. If the check succeeds, he tells the characters, "Evil's twin hides its face for now. Expect that to change before winter's end." (This is an oblique reference to [[Manshoon]].) The characters can descend the mountain safely. Reward: Each Gray Hand character gains 1 renown.
#### The Force Grey contact
- [[Vajra Safahr]]
>I am Vajra Safahr, the Qinnen. Come to [[Qinqen Tower]] in the Castle Ward near the [[White Road]] at once. Bring your friends.
### [[Harpers|Harper]] mission
- "One of the drays working in the city is pulled by a talking mare named Maxeene. Locate her, find out if she's learned the identity of any Zhent operatives, and if so, determine their whereabouts."
- Characters can find Maxeene, a draft horse with an Intelligence score of 10, with a successful `DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check`. Maxeene speaks Common, and characters must try to convince her that they're Harpers by making a `DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check`. If the check succeeds, the horse recalls giving a ride to a sun elf and his half-orc bodyguard two days ago; she picked them up at an intersection (she doesn't recall which one) and dropped them off at the Yawning Portal. They talked about hiring spies to root out [[Xanathar Guild]] hideouts in the city. Maxeene's descriptions of the passengers match the appearances of [[Davil Starsong]] and [[Yagra Stonefist]]. Reward: Each Harper character gains 1 renown and 5 gp.
#### Harper contact
>Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Art Ward. If you are interested, meet [[Mirt]] at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance.
- Enclosed are tickets for the entire party to The Fall of Oria, an opera sung in Elvish,  describing the evil evil earth elemental's defeat at the Well of Dragons. 
- Mirt is the main Harper contact
- Lightsinger Theater is a high-end establishment located in the Art Ward. If the characters meet Mirt in his private box during the opera's intermission, he describes the Harpers and offers membership to eligible characters. Characters who accept receive a silver pin of a harp within a crescent moon, along with their first mission (see the Harpers Missions table). Mirt also tells them that if they ever need to speak with him directly, they are welcome to visit his manor in the [[Sea Ward]]. If the characters do visit Mirt's manor, there's a 90 percent chance that Mirt isn't home and no one answers the door.

### [[Lords' Alliance]] mission
- "A gang war is causing unrest throughout the city. We have offered protection to members of the [[Dungsweepers' Guild]], and you have been assigned to protect a group of them. Meet them at the [[The Cloak and Stagger Tavern]], on Ship Street in the [[Harbor Ward]], at six bells and guard them while they work. Do this every day for a tenday."
- Each morning, the characters meet with a team of four dungsweepers (commoners) and head to the Trades Ward, where the sweepers spend the day cleaning up waste in the streets. It's boring work. On the ninth day, around highsun, a carrion crawler emerges from a nearby alley, pursued by two City Watch guards. The characters can help slay the carrion crawler, which came up from the sewers. Reward: Each Lords' Alliance character gains 1 renown and 1 gp at the end of the protection (if successful).
#### Lords' Alliance contact
- [[Jalester Silvermane]]
- The characters' primary contact is Jalester Silvermane (see appendix B), a field agent who reports to Open Lord Laeral Silverhand. Jalester spends much of his time in the Yawning Portal and other taverns that adventurers are known to frequent. Jalester offers membership in the Lords' Alliance to those who qualify. Members are expected to complete whatever missions are assigned to them in a timely, professional manner. Refusing to accept or complete a mission can result in suspension or dismissal. An alliance member who is suspended receives no alliance missions until the suspension ends, while dismissal from the alliance means a loss of membership and the loss of all renown in the faction.
### [[Order of the Gauntlet]] mission
- "We hear that the [[Zhentarim|Zhents]] are paying gangs in the River Ward of [[Norslums]] to attack suspected [[Xanathar Guild]] members. Fights are breaking out in the ward daily. Stop a fight before it happens. We need to send a message to these thugs that further altercations won't be tolerated."
- The characters must visit the River Ward and, as a fight threatens to break out, make three successful `DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation) checks` before failing three checks, or else defeat four **thugs** (preferably without killing them) to disperse the would-be brawlers. Reward: Each Order of the Gauntlet character gains 1 renown.
#### Order of the Gauntlet contact 
- [[Savra Belabranta]]
- If the party includes one or more likely recruits, Savra Belabranta (NG female Tethyrian human knight) visits the characters' residence and invites them to the Halls of Justice, the temple of Tyr (located west of the Market in the Castle Ward), where they can be sworn into the order. The swearing-in ceremony involves the recitation of an oath to find and destroy evil in all its forms. The oath is spoken while every candidate wears a silver gauntlet (a symbol of the order). After the ceremony, Savra gives new recruits their first mission. The Belabrantas are a Wightwateran noble family that raises griffons for the Griffon Cavalry. Savra is trying to regain her honor by serving Tyr, thus atoning for the evil acts she committed as a member of an evil elemental cult called the Howling Hatred. Savra's sins are irrelevant to this adventure, but you can learn more about her past in Princess of the Apocalypse. Whenever she has a mission for the characters, she communicates the missive to them herself.
### [[Zhentarim]] mission
- "Someone is killing elf and half-elf sailors in the Harbor Ward - three dead so far, each one decapitated by a blade in the dead of night. Look into it, will you? Methinks the City Watch could use a little help."
- Characters who spend three consecutive nights loitering around the docks spot Heldar, a drunk half-elf sailor (**bandit**), leaving the [[The Cloak and Stagger Tavern]] (on Ship Street in the Harbor Ward). Characters who follow Heldar can save him from [[Soluun Xibrindas]], a renegade **drow gunslinger** (see appendix B). Soluun hides in the shadows, blade drawn, waiting for the half-elf to stumble by. Spotting him before he strikes requires a successful `DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check`. Soluun flees if reduced to half his hit points or fewer. Reward: Each Zhentarim character gains 1 renown. If Heldar survives Soluun's attack, each character receives 50 gp.
#### Zhentarim contact
- A flying snake with a parchment tied about its body visits one character in the dead of night. The message reads:
>Want to be part of something big? Speak to Davil Starsong at the Yawning Portal.
- If the characters seek out Davil, Yagra Stonefist (see "Familiar Faces," page 20) greets them and leads interested parties to a table in the center of the Yawning Portal's taproom, where her boss waits with drink in band.
- [[Davil Starsong]]
- Davil Starsong (see appendix B) is the characters' primary contact in the Black Network, at least initially. Over drinks, he shares the following information:
	- Davil is a retired adventurer. He and his adventuring companions joined the Zhentarim a few years back. They help people in need. (More specifically, they provide loans. mercenaries, and other services.)
	- Another Black Network gang has recently infiltrated the city and tried to take over the Xanathar Guild. They failed, setting off a war in the streets. Davil and his colleagues want to end the violence and restore the peace.
- Davil offers membership in the faction to interested characters, then assigns them their first mission (see the Zhentarim Missions table). Subsequent mission briefings are written on scrolls and delivered by flying snakes.
- [[Tashlyn Yafeera]]
- After the characters complete two missions for Davil, he is arrested by the City Watch and held in [[Oria Castle]] while he waits to be questioned by the Council of Wightwater about the Black Network's operations in the city. The characters continue to receive missions, but they come from Tashlyn Yafeera (see appendix B). Characters first become aware of this change when they receive their next mission briefing, since it's written in a different hand.
- If the characters want lo speak with Tashlyn direclty, Yagra can arrange a meeting in [[The Boastful Bard]] or some other quiet place. By the time the characters see her, Tashlyn has learned the following information:
	- The rumored leader of the renegade Zhent faction is [[Urstul Floxin]], a known Black Network assassin.
	- A warrant has been issued for Urstul's arrest, but his current whereabouts are unknown. Even magical scrying has failed to reveal his location.
	- The botched kidnapping of Renaer Neverember won't sit well with Urstul. He might try again. (Tashlyn doesn't actually believe this, but she knows that Renaer has ties to the Harpers and might share information of interest with the characters.)
	- Weeks after his arrest, Davil is released from custody once the [[Council of Wightwater]] are satisfied that neither he nor his associates are responsible for the recent violence.
## Business rival
- [[Emmek Frewn]] a salty northerner (NE male Dikonian commoner), recently tried to buy the tavern in [[Pixiedust Alley]] but was outbid by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Stung by the loss, he bought a smaller, less impressive building in the same alley and turned it into a pub, which he calls Frewn's Brews. If you decide to introduce Emmek as a business rival, choose an unmarked building on map 2.1 to serve as the pub.
- Emmek's family migrated to Wightwater after its holdings in <new town name/> were destroyed by the eruption of <new mountain name/> in <correct time for time period/>. The family struggled to make ends meet by tanning leather in the Trades Ward. After Emmek's parents died, his sisters took over the business and bought him out. He never liked the work anyway, and he particularly hated dealing with the League of Skinners and Tanners.
-  Emmek is on shaky financial footing because he bas sunk most of his wealth into this latest endeavor. He's also in trouble with two of the guilds. First, he tried to save coin by fixing the roof himself. in defiance of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild. Then he offended a member of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild by comparing the dwarf's beard to barnacles on a ship.
## Level up!
To level 3

## Start of chapter 3
If the characters opened the business (w/o destroying Lif) read the following, otherwise skip to the next paragraph
> During a quiet, late afternoon, with a few patrons dining and a broom sweeping a section of the floor, it's a peaceful afternoon.

If the chars opened the restaurant and destroyed Lif
>During a quiet, late afternoon, with a few patrons dining, it's a peaceful afternoon.
Somewhat hot, the constant cool sea breeze over the city makes the heat bearable. The group is relaxing around a pint of their own stock, laughing and joking, tending to the patrons as needed. 

Then read this:
>The past couple tenday have been very good for the party, and they all have an opportunity to relax. A bright light flashes outside the windows, followed by a roar that rattles the doors and windows of the Manor and Pixiedust Alley. As you rush outside, you see part of [[Corellon's Crown]] smoking and burning, with charred bodies strewn about. Screams fill the air as a thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward from the blast.
