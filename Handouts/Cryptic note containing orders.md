# The letter
- [[The Handsome Fae (AKA Moonbean)|Moonbean]] carries around a letter containing his next orders. However, [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]], has a specific cipher and code she uses to encrypt the message, so if it falls into someone else's hands, they won't be able to decipher it.
- It has the following orders encoded on it -


>Proceed to the [[Quenval]] Villa  
>I have it on reliable authority that the household maintains a cache of items of potential value to the Project. All indications suggest it is concealed within the structure itself—likely within a wall.
>A replacement living conduit of sufficient arcane density is required. This is not negotiable. The subject must arrive **undamaged**.
>We will attempt a different extraplanar origin. The previous specimen was inadequate, though the data obtained remains useful.
>Avoid unnecessary casualties. The assets previously discussed **cannot** be terminated. If credible risk to their lives presents itself, intervene to ensure survival—no more than is required.
>Time is no longer a luxury. The day approaches.

**— RQ**

## In-game
Before the players get to the actual letter (the cipher), they need to get past arcane ciphering (using dispel magic/arcana check or some outside wizard help). The description would be something like - 

>A quick glance at the folded paper shows oddly spaced - and formed - letters and symbols, with arcane glyphs floating around, making it hard to focus on any one section for long. This paper is obviously magically protected, to keep prying eyes away from secrets they shouldn't know.

>After getting the magic cipher off the letter, the symbols and letters you see on the page make no more sense to you than they did before. This looks like gibberish, maybe something to throw you off - but maybe there is a method to the madness.
