# Laundering money
[[Xerxes (fake) - Fleet Fibblewibble|Fleet]] wants to launder money through the tavern. To do this, I will roll the `d100 + 10`  privately. Then, I will have everyone give me a number between 0 and 1000, noting each, but only adding the amount Brian said to the roll.

I will roll the `d100 + 10` privately. I will give everyone a vague descriptor of how you did this tenday ("You feel as if you came out on top this week"). Then, I will have everyone tell me a number between 0 and 1000 and note each of them. Your number will be the amount you feel comfortable laundering through the business and then I will read the number and description aloud

For each 1000 gp laundered through the  business that increases the chances of an audit by 5%. The base chance per tenday is 0.5% (roll a `d1000`, and it has to be 5 on that or below, then add 50 to that number to increase it).
