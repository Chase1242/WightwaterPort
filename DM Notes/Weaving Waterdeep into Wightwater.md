# Overview

In this section of notes I will deliberate and settle upon a course of action to weave Waterdeep into my homebrew world and overall story. I would checkout [[Conversion notes from module to Wightwater]] to get a sense of what has been accomplished so far (hint: not much).

## Chapter 1
---
This section is pretty straight forward, the players are introduced at the [[Yawning Portal]], a tavern that is a known spot for all kinds of people to be. 

They get into a fight (if they choose) with some bandits and in the third round of the fight, a troll and three dirges come to fight too.

After the fight with the troll, the dead bodies of the monsters would be disposed of, and a representative the [[Guild of Potion Brewers and Poison Makers]] will talk to Durnan about paying Durnan to retrieve the body of the troll and dirges as soon as he can get men to haul the bodies off. Durnan has people drag the bodies off to the alley out back. By the time [[Wrex Pothor]], arrives, the bodies have died. A drunk by the name of [[Grungar the Drunk]], a bugbear, saw a white mask outside while he was peeing, but he has been known to spread rumors. With the rumors of the [[White Mask|White Masks]] floating about the city, everyone assumes he is trying to get a rise out of the other patrons, and they promptly ignore him.

Unbeknownst to the party, the Gazer, any monster, and any magic user that dies in the sewers and [[Chapter 1 - A Friend in Need#Xanathar Guild Hideout|Xanathar Guild Hideout]] will be scooped up by the same [[White Mask]] that got the troll and dirges.

Rumors from the Xanathar Guild circulate, saying that the entire hideout went missing, while there were signs of a fight and blood stains, there were no bodies when a group of the Xanathar Guild checked the hideout out. 

If they are out at night, there is a 60% chance the party is being followed by a White Mask, and the party may role 
## Chapter 2

This is TBD based on the [[Factions PCs may join]]. Will differ based on each quest (I will probably weave an interaction with a [[White Mask]]/a slow spell into one or two of the quests).
