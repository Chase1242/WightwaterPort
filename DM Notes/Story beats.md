# Story idea
The party, as a bunch of low level adventurers, decide to join the adventurers guild because they all have seek the thrill of the fight and solving problems. So, as some level ones and friends, they band together to form an adventuring party. They tackle their first quests, levelling up, noticing some oddities.

Each quest will have to take place at night - each to stop something magical from occurring. On each of their quests, they succeed in the fight or whatever, and start to gather proof of what they had done for the quest for their reward.

Upon going to gather the proof, a figure in all black clothes with a slightly glowing white mask shows up to collect the stuff for them and allows them to take a little proof, but "disposes" of it for them.

Each of these quests in [[#Act 1]] have them moving around [[Wightwater]], doing small things that don't seem too connected, until it comes to a head and they fight the person that was helping them (should be level 3 at this point).

After they fight (and presumably kill) [[White Mask]], they will probably bring this to the Council, after which the Council would assign them to investigate it. At level 3, they would be allowed into the "next tier" of the quests. This would give them a chance to go against more  [[White Mask|White Mask's]], as people with hints of magical connections (or even beings with magical properties) seem to be disappearing.

During [[#Act 2]], they would also get smaller quests to complete, that allow them a little more info into exactly "who" the White Mask's are. Maybe a chase or something else brings them to where they come from, which is a cloning chamber  of sorts, producing these figures of White Masks, some marked differently to tell which one can do what.

Also during [[#Act 2]] they will sometimes be slowed, and sometimes hasted (but without the Haste drawback, yet), as the High Mage works to use his machine to test it on them. (Should sparingly use the Slow/Hasted mechanic without some sort of DC save at least, or way to break out of it).

After finding the lair of the High Mage, the High Mage will flee and they will fight some of the "minions" who should be pretty strong after the high mage dips.

The High Mage will then remove any evidence of their lair, moving stuff and burning out the lair.

The party should be level 6 at this point, and ready to enter [[#Act 3]].

Act 3 consists of the players having to prove it was the High Mage, while taking more quests that lead them to more evidence that it is the High Mage. (Maybe a quest that leads them to a collection of magical entities that are being used as a "battery," but each body is just a husk, fed to stay alive, with no thoughts (brain dead)).

After that, the High Mage will do what they can to kill them (including assassins) and giving the Adventurer's Guild quests specifically for them (if they don't take them they might be disqualified from adventuring since they don't have real proof against the High Mage yet??). These will be hard quests designed to kill them but everyone at the AG congratulates them because they are getting special recognition from the High Mage.

After they hit level 9-10, they will have enough evidence to confront the High Mage at the Council (requiring checks to persuade them). The High Mage will deny, obviously casting a charming spell to get them to believe her. In a debate style battle (see Rob's Laethil fight) they will try to convince the Council of her. If they win, she will teleport away from the shame (and jail) to figure out how she is going to make this appropriate sacrifice. 

All while this is happening, there are reports of a war on the distant edge of the state, with an enemy force on the war path to secure Wightwater Port as a trading port.

## Points to consider
- Only slow the players, never haste
	- Mark each slow and when they confront the BBEG in [[#Act 2]] the machine back fires and removes part of their action economy (a leg. action, regular action, etc)
	- When she dies (if) in [[#Act 2]] it would have been a clone, and her consciousness would go to her real body
	- Clone would have worse magical items and she would come fully prepped for the next 
- Debate for final confrontation (like Rob).
	- If they lose they will have to confront them later.
	- If they start a fight they get jailed and sentenced to death (chance to escape.)
- Have multiple lairs: with some piece of evidence that ties the High Mage back to the White Masks
- One place (a long forgotten underground cave) for the magical battery thing
- Other adventuring parties are visited by the [[White Mask|White Masks]] as well.
- The white masks is what controls the person, and once it is on they must make wisdom saves to stop from being enchanted
- Originally, when sent to explore, Sagillus, Radelia, and a couple others were out on a mission (with other adventuring parties) to explore the wilderness and find the source of the elementals on the plane. 
	- The elementals don't allow a fair chunk of land to be settled in ([[Yttria]])
	- Eventually, they find a mountain-like Earth elemental that guards the rip between the planes, and close it after dispersing of it
- Titivilus, a cunning, scheming devil, seeing the latent power within Radelia, knew she would be prime to push over the edge to make a favorable deal
	- He starts whispering in her ear from the moment she leaves the capital of [[Ebros]], a few words while she meditates her and a few there, to sow doubt and push her to the edge.
	- Titivilus would also orchestrate a raiding of the elemental planes to shove them through the portal to make Radelia's despair overwhelming.
	- In the process of them closing the rip, Sagillus is struck down and elementals, sensing the portal closing with magic on the other side of that, start flooding through the gate. When all seems lost, tickle in the back of her mind, gets her to utter the phrase "I want to make a deal!"
	- Time slows, comes to a halt, and Titivilus (who is disguised to not look so devil-like) walks through and offers her power to scour the elementals away and close the portal (along with let's say, a 2 level increase) in return for a lock of her hair and the promise to see Titivilus in the future for an "appropriate sacrifice"
- Party encounters a white mask having just killed another adventuring party
- Party encounters that same party as white masks?
- **The River Qinqen:**  
	- Maybe the magical runoff from the machine is slowly polluting or corrupting the river. Eventually, even ghosts or spirits are seen floating upstream.
