Fresh from passing the tests to be officially recognized as fledgling adventurers, you are gathered by [[Shadya Reth]], an advanced transmutation wizard and leader of the city’s guild house, for your final assessment. This assessment will determine your party’s ranking among all adventuring parties, especially the new ones. Joined by camaraderie, ale, childhoods, or ambition, you are ready (or not) to be the next grand adventurers of [[Wightwater||Wightwater Port]] - the trading capital of the [[Ebros|Kingdom of Ebros]]!  

You dream of the day you are hailed by the folk of the city, but the initial quest board for new adventuring parties doesn't feel that heroic—petty thefts, slight magical disturbances, or escorting shipments. The path to becoming known may not be what all the stories seem to make it ... but no matter! One day you WILL be great adventurers. 

Besides, even if the start is small, there have been rumors whispered among the common folk and the low-level adventuring parties. Rumors mothers tell their children to get them to bed at night. Rumors of floating white masks, seen at night, watching, waiting, but never intervening. 

The rumors of the common people whisper that the white masks are a guard dispatched by the [[Council of Wightwater]] to help keep the city safe with the booming populace. Others say they are meant to root out cults, or frowned upon magics, or a million other things on the tongues of frightened people. 

Adventuring parties seem to see them more than the common folk, and from what you gleamed from conversations in the guild house, they see them more often at night.  But the thing that bothers them the most is that whatever "mess" remains when they are done, it is always gone by morning. 

 But you are brand new adventurers. What's there to do but the tasks in front of you? 

Something is off in the city, and those white masks are a clear indication. But why isn't anyone doing anything? It may be up to you to find out.

## Polished version
Fresh from passing the tests to be officially recognized as beginner adventurers, you are summoned by [[Shadya Reth]], a seasoned transmutation wizard and one of the heads of the city's guild house. This is your final assessment: to determine where your party ranks on the official registry of adventuring groups. Joined by camaraderie, ale, childhood bonds, or sheer ambition, you stand ready to take your first steps as the next great adventurers of [[Wightwater||Wightwater Port]], the bustling trade capital of the [[Ebros|Kingdom of Ebros]]—or so you hope.

You dream of glory, of being hailed by the people in the streets—but the jobs on the new adventurers' quest board hardly feel heroic. Petty thefts, minor magical mishaps, escorting supply caravans… The path to fame seems less like the legends and more like hard work. Still, no matter. One day, you _will_ be great. You _will_ be remembered.

Lately, though, rumors have begun to spread—quietly, uneasily. Tales whispered by the common folk and low-ranking adventurers alike. Stories mothers murmur to restless children to hasten sleep. Stories of [[White Mask|white masks]], floating in the night: watching, waiting… never intervening.

Adventuring parties claim to see them more often, only during nighttime quests. They don’t speak, don’t interfere—but by morning, any mess left behind on the job is... simply gone.

Some say they’re a secret city guard, dispatched by the [[Council of Wightwater]] to keep order in the ever-growing city. Others believe they’re hunting cults, extinguishing rogue magic, or enacting stranger, darker missions. The theories multiply like shadows—but you're just getting started. Your only concern, for now, is the task in front of you.

Still, something is off in Wightwater. You can feel it.  
And those white masks? 
They’re not watching _nothing_.
