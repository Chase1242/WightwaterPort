The Verdant Tangle is the last remaining foothold of [[Yttria]], before the [[Faewild]] migrates to a new area of the world. This forest is south of the [[Chorad Forests]], and while the Chorad is a tropic rainforest, the Tangle is a temperate rainforest, with pines and cedars. This is an ancient forest with large trees and a magic to it, which is why the [[Nackle Clan]] and many other forest gnome clans call it their home.
