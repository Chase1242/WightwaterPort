# Faewild
The Faewild isn't restricted to one place on the plane of [[Issuria]]. It shifts, moving to where it feels, which makes histories of each area unique, leaving some peoples with folktales after the Faewild moves on.

The Faewild is also a place where the strange and odd are, well, normal. Chance in the faewild is an odd thing, where one might toss 6 dice 6 times in a row and only roll ones. Plants grow at odd times, and eating the plants causes things to happen.

Only once the Faewild has been rooted for a couple years can the visual effects start to be noticed, and the same for the magical effects of the Faewild. They ramp up over time, and when the Faewild moves, it takes a while for things to return to normal.

The Faewild isn't evil, but nor is it good. The Faewild and Archfey of the Faewild serve themselves and their interests, as well as the fae of the Faewild.  

## [[Oria]] and the Faewild
Oria, the Ancient Earth Elemental, and the [[Archfey]] (and therefore, Faewild), came to a mutual agreement to settle in [[Yttria]], an unsettled territory of the world brimming with magic and fae beings. 

The agreement wasn't what you or I would consider a conventional agreement. There wasn't pens or paper, or even language involved. The Archfey respected the immense magical energy Oria carried to help keep the rift between the elemental planes open, and Oria respected the Archfey because of their power. Thus, they came to an agreement of mutual aid, where the land stayed unsettled by those pesky races that brought an unnecessary amount of rules and order.

The relative peace of the Faewild existed for a while until [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen|Radelia Qinqen]] and [[Sagillus Wightwater]] and their adventuring party penetrated the Faewild deeper than most have been able to go, straight to [[Oria]]. This is where Oria was felled, and where the peace of the Faewilds ended. The Fae, not unable to protect themselves, withdrew as the settlers moved in in droves. The settlers disrupted the flow of the Fae, sometimes hostile and killing the Fae, and sometimes coexisting, but the Archfey and Faewilds felt it was time to move and migrate away.

## Revenge of the Faewilds
In the nearly 200 years since the death of Oria's death on *this plane*, the Archfey haven't forgiven the High Mage for her role in the slaying of Oria. The Archfey however, aren't ones to start wars, but they are ones to plot, against each other, their patrons, their enemies, and sometimes even random mortals that they feel like messing with.

The Archfey have time, and so they plan and plot, waiting for the right time to bring all of their plots together, and ensnare the High Mage in their revenge. 

Having the sights of the Archfey set on you isn't a position of envy, and you hope the move on quickly. This may not be the case for Radelia...
