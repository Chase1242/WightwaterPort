___
### Why is it there?
[[Wightwater]] is situated on part of the continent once known as [[Yttria]], where elementals had run wild, until ~200 years ago, when [[Sagillus Wightwater]] and [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]] sealed the elementals from this plane and revealed a deep, natural harbor. The harbor and river combo allow for easy trade and commerce.

___
### Is the city walled? Or protected by any natural features?

### What is the government?
The government is a council/pseudo-elected council. One person from each of the [[Guilds]] is sent to represent that guild, along with 4 people democratically elected by the people. 

Common folk can bring petitions to the council, along with other plights, that require large scale reaction. The council holds votes on certain agenda items, with important ones (regarding the cities constitution or rights of beings) requiring a super majority (>66.6%), while the others are a majority (>50%).

___
### What kind of legal system, if any, is there?
The legal system is devised of a couple parts.
1. There are jails, and executions are still a thing for people proven to have done horrendous things.
2. Disputes are settled by a local magistrate, where there are a couple for the bigger/richer sections of the city.
3. There is no public defense, you are investigated for a crime and investigators either prove you are innocent or guilty. You can hire other investigators to corroborate or deny their story.
4. Jail time is usually a reasonable amount of time, and can be appealed once by the jailed party.
	1. Escaped inmates get double the sentence. 
	2. If escaped for longer than your remaining time, you are no longer an escaped prisoner.
