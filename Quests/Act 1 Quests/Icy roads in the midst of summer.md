Early in the mornings, in parts of the market, there seems to be a thick sheet of ice on the ground. This is causing the market to open later than normal.

## DM
- There was a small rift that spit out a couple of ice mephits that come out at night/right before dawn and ice sections of the street for fun.
- They are in a battle with a couple small water elementals, in a bid for that section of the street.
