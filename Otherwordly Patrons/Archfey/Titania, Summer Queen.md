## Origins

## Plots
Titania, while able to paralyze mortals with her own gaze, follows [[Ao]]'s rule of not interfering with mortal affairs... directly. When [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen|Radelia Qinqen]], on her last legs, brought [[Oria|Oria, The Ancient Earth Elemental]], down and closed the rift of the portal, she swore to bring Radelia down when she was highest. [[Titania's Diary]] contains an entry on 12 Auranday, Kossent, 2876 [[Ages|AME]], with her account of events.

Since that day, she has sent the other Archfey on plots and started spinning her own plots.
