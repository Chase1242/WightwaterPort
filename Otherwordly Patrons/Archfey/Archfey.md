# History
The Archfey of [[Issuria]] are a set of beings that came to be powerful beings of the [[Faewild]] that got there not necessarily based on their power before becoming Archfey. They were, in some way, important to the other fae and possibly even the Issurians that live in settlements and cities. And through that importance, however they gained it, were born the Archfey.

Once the Archfey reached that status and covered a domain, their importance remained, but they were "built-in" to the environment or mortal races. 

## Fall of [[Oria]]
[[Titania, Summer Queen]], widely regarded in the world of the Fae to be the strongest of the Fae, had a deep respect for Oria, and felt a deep loss, both magically and personally. The mutual agreement respected by both the Fae and Elementals was lost when [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen|Radelia Qinqen]], [[Sagillus Wightwater]], and their adventuring party felled Oria, despite the best efforts from the [[Courts of the Archfey]] to turn the party away non-confrontationally.

When Radelia succeeded on closing the [[Rift to the Elemental Plane]] and wiping out the elementals, she and Sagillus drew the ire of the Archfey, even if they didn't know it at the time.

Titania, Queen of Summer, and the rest of the Archfey have been planning and plotting for 200 years, and the upcoming [[The Wightwater Ducentanos|Wightwater Ducentanos]] happens to be the perfect time for the strands of plots to come together and ensnare Radelia for the revenge of the death of Oria.
