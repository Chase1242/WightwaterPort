# Overview
---
When Kronos was chopped up and overthrown by Zeus and cast into the [[Pit of Tartarus]],  the pieces fell, and fell, and fell, for a long time. The Pits are a magical place that exist near the intersection of the planes, where mortals have never been, in the Far Realms. As his pieces fell, one piece, through Kronos' sheer force of will, fell into a *fold* between the planes. This piece fell, for longer, eventually finding the plane that the world [[Issuria]] exists in. That piece made it's way onto the world, landing deep within the [[Faewild]]. Overtime, with the magical assistance of the Faewild, the piece took on mass and slowly formed into the Arch-Hag [[Kronol]]. Kronol, connected to the will of Kronos, did what Kronos wanted, in her own way, of course. Kronol, with some of the knowledge of Kronos, called to mortals in dreams and whispers, calling them to seek her out. When they came, they took deals that made them do things, two of which were necessary for [[Aldarian Woods]] and [[Ahriola Teetons]] backstories. She made a bargain with [[The Handsome Fae]] to do one thing - eliminate their families, as the will of Kronos dictated. So he did that, in return for a future where he always succeeds at what he wants (as long as it doesn't threaten the hag and is not unrealistic).
