[[Victoro Cassalanter|Victoro]] and [[Ammalia Cassalanter|Ammalia]] Cassalanter are Wightwateran nobles and secret devil worshipers. The Cassalanters plan to use the cache of dragons to buy back the souls of their children, which they traded to Dispater for power. Their estate, [[Cassalanter Villa]], has a temple of Asmodeus hidden underneath it, as described in chapter 6.

The Cassalanters try to misdirect and discredit the characters rather than murder them. Victoro and Ammalia rely on their noble status to protect them, and the last thing they want is the City Watch on their doorstep. 

If you choose the Cassalanters as the villains, the adventure takes place in the summer.
