[[Victoro Cassalanter|Victoro]] and [[Ammalia Cassalanter|Ammalia]] Cassalanter are Wightwateran nobles and secret devil worshipers. The Cassalanters plan to use the cache of dragons to buy back the souls of their children, which they traded to Asmodeus for power. Their estate, [[Cassalanter Villa]], has a temple of Asmodeus hidden underneath it, as described in chapter 6.

The Cassalanters try to misdirect and discredit the characters rather than murder them. Victoro and Ammalia rely on their noble status to protect them, and the last thing they want is the City Watch on their doorstep. 

If you choose the Cassalanters as the villains, the adventure takes place in the summer.

## Cassalanter's connection to broader story
- They are notified of [[Corwin FibbleWibble|Corwin FibbleWibble's]] incursion into sealed records, which they know contain damning evidence for them, concerning [[Xerxes (fake) - Fleet Fibblewibble|Fleet]] being their child (even though they don't know his real name), as well as other doings that may not be entirely above water (laundering, etc.).
- As such, they kidnap Corwin to keep him from talking, leaving his house a wreck as they were searching for what he knew after they hauled him off.
- They chain him up, set up to be a sacrifice to the cult
