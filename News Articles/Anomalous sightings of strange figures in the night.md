Residents across several wards continue to report disturbing encounters with white-masked figures haunting the rooftops and high places of the city under the cover of darkness. While officials urge calm, the Wazoo has spoken with enough witnesses to suggest that something unusual—if not outright uncanny—is unfolding in Wightwater.

In the [[North Harbor]], a woman described awakening to strange noises outside her home and glimpsing two masked figures crouched on a nearby rooftop, each wearing a white mask carved with a different expression—one twisted in silent laughter, the other frozen in a mournful frown. 

Another witness, a lamplighter near the [[Dead Man's Yard]], the largest graveyard in [[Wightwater]], insists he saw a mask carved with four jagged slashes hovering in midair before a body “formed around it like an afterthought.” A carriage driver entering the ward at dusk described a tall figure wearing a mask split perfectly down the middle—one half serene, the other contorted in a scream. “It tilted its head at me,” he said, “as though deciding whether I mattered.”

Other reports drift into the more sensational. [[Kalby Durnhast]] of Trades Ward continues to claim he was abducted by a “ten-foot-tall, three-eyed, white-masked giant” that floated away after issuing a cryptic warning about “watching the skies.” While no one has corroborated his tale, it has made him a minor attraction at his local tavern, "Good for What Ales Ya."

Despite the fear, confusion, and occasional embellishment, a consistent description emerges from every witness. The masks are always white—sometimes described as softly glowing—and each one bears a unique, vivid expression. The figures appear suddenly and silently, often in the aftermath of magical disturbances, as though drawn to the trace of arcane activity. Not a single witness has reported hearing them arrive or depart. They are always first seen standing utterly still, watching something… or someone.

One particularly striking account comes from a half-elf rescued recently during a violent clash between Zhentarim agents in the streets. According to his statement, he was saved by a group consisting of “a stout gnome, a tiefling, a satyr, and another half-elf.” After the skirmish, as the group caught their breath, he looked back down the alley and noticed a single white mask staring down from a nearby rooftop. “It wasn’t looking at me,” he insisted. “It was watching them. Like it had been waiting for them to appear.”

When approached for comment, [[Vajra Safahr]], the Blackstaff, acknowledged the growing number of reports but offered only measured reassurance. “Citizens should not jump to conclusions,” she said. “Unexplained arcane phenomena are not necessarily hostile. The Blackstaff Tower is investigating these sightings, and we ask that people avoid contact and report incidents immediately.”

Still, Wightwater remains unsettled. The white masks continue to appear just after the echoes of magic fade, each bearing a different face, each observing in chilling silence.

And the question persists:
What are these figures—and why do they watch from the rooftops?
