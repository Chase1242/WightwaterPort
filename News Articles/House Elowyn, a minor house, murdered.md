**TRAGIC SCENE IN THE NORTH WARD: ELOWYN HOUSEHOLD FOUND SLAIN UNDER GRISLY CIRCUMSTANCES**  
_By [[Ellisar Thenn]], Staff Reporter for the [[Wightwater Wazoo]]_

Citizens of Waterdeep awoke this morning to chilling news from the usually placid North Ward, where the entire **Elowyn noble household** was discovered slain under circumstances so macabre that even the City Watch has issued requests for calm and discretion. The [[House Elowyn|Elowyns]]—long whispered to possess a trace of **Fey blood** in their lineage—were found dead late last night following a neighbor’s report of strange silence and shuttered lights.

According to preliminary statements from the Watch, the residence contained **eleven dead**—five household servants, four adult heirs of the family, and the two parents. Three additional house guards were recovered alive, though rendered near-catatonic, described by witnesses as “drooling, glass-eyed, and utterly unresponsive to sound, touch, or light.”

The scene inside has been described by investigators as deeply disturbing.

The **parents**, both bound, appear to have been killed last. One victim was found **partially petrified**, with a section of their skull **sheared away** as though ripped by tremendous force. The other bore a matching wound—a ragged cavity where part of the head should have been. No signs of tools or blades were discovered that could match the nature of the injuries.

The **four adult children** were located in adjacent chambers, similarly bound. Evidence indicates they suffered prolonged torment prior to death—and, most grimly, that this torment occurred **within sight of their parents**, who were evidently forced to witness the cruelty before meeting their own fate.

The **servants**, in contrast, were dispatched swiftly—each with a precise slit along the throat, suggesting practiced efficiency or a professional hand.

Adding to the mystery, several **floorboards had been forcibly uprooted**, revealing an **empty recess** beneath the main study. Watchful speculation suggests that a chest or protected container once rested there—now missing. Whether its absence motivated the attack or resulted from it remains unknown.

Watch Commander Halvar Dren has stated only that “the investigation remains ongoing,” though he confirmed that the unusual nature of the injuries has prompted consultation with both the Blackstaff’s agents and certain clerics versed in curses, petrification, enchantment, and other supernatural afflictions.

Residents of the North Ward are urged to remain vigilant and report any unusual behavior, strangers, or arcane disturbances. Rumors already swirl—ranging from hired assassins to Fey retribution to extraplanar predators—but the Watch has cautioned against premature conclusions.

The _Wazoo_ will provide updates as more information becomes available.
