_By Blommar Grower, Culinary Crusader for the Wightwater Wazoo_

Wightwater’s culinary world is in _uproar_—and for once, it’s not because someone tried to pass off a gray ooze as artisanal pudding. No, dear readers, the scandal rocking our fair city today concerns the beloved (and, until recently, reasonably priced) eatery **Roast Beef, Sausage, and Eggs**, which has stunned customers with meat prices so astronomical they could make even a well-paid adventurer reconsider their breakfast plans.

Patrons arriving for their usual morning feast were reportedly greeted by a chalkboard reading:  
**ROAST BEEF — 12 GOLD**  
**SAUSAGE LINKS — 9 GOLD PER LINK**  
**EGGS — “NEGOTIABLE”**

Yes. _Negotiable._ The establishment’s proprietor, one Faldun Lardle, claims these prices are the natural result of “supply chain disruptions, interplanar tariffs, and a minor but ongoing issue with sentient cows refusing to be eaten.” When pressed for details, he elaborated only that the cows had “unionized” and were now “demanding paid leave.”

One disgruntled customer, furious after being charged 48 gold for a four-link sausage platter, told the Wazoo:

> “I didn’t negotiate the eggs. I didn’t know you had to negotiate the eggs. I thought they were joking. They were not joking.”

Another patron claims he attempted to pay using a small ruby he found while adventuring, only to be informed that the gem was worth _less_ than a side of bacon—bacon which is now priced “by emotional value” rather than weight.

The most scandalous report, however, comes from a bard who swears the restaurant is secretly in league with a group of hungry basilisks. According to this bard (who requested anonymity to protect his remaining limbs), the basilisks are allegedly “sitting in the cellar,” and customers unwilling to pay full price are “encouraged” to negotiate with them directly.

Faldun Lardle denies all allegations of basilisk collusion, insisting,

> “The only creatures influencing our pricing are the invisible hand of the market and the _very visible_ bite marks in my siding left by disobedient cows.”

Whether this pricing scandal is a temporary blip or the beginning of Wightwater’s first-ever breakfast crisis remains to be seen. Until then, diners are encouraged to bring extra coin, emotional fortitude, and perhaps a skilled negotiator for any egg-related haggling.

And so the question looms:  
**At what point does a sausage stop being food and start becoming a status symbol?** Only time (and your wallet) will tell.
