## Backstory
---
A Tiefling is a sign. Physical evidence of a forbidden Pact. My parents could be anyone in the city, from a lowly gambler who just needed a win to a high political figure who can't afford devil shaped stains on their reputation. Either way, I had to find ways to get by on my own. But with my talents, I didn't just survive in Wightwater, I thrived. With deft fingers and a sly smile, I made a name for myself as a kid on the streets with nothing to lose. Until, I took a job for a high crime boss in the port. The details were sketchy, but I was to act as a distraction by performing on a street over. Halfway through my act, I would use a sleep scroll on my crowd, hopefully having drawn in some authorities, and clean all their pockets. Little did I know, I was the fall guy. My sleep scroll was a fake and I was arrested. There I stood in front of court justice FibbleWibble, a gnome who served the justice department of the Port Authority. Normally known for having little mercy and harsh punishments, for some reason, he took pity on me. Seeing an 11-year-old Tiefling boy in chains was too much for him, so now I call him Dad. He took me in and loved me in a way I had never felt before. He encouraged me to mold my talents into a Legal Society. I began acting at the local theaters and Taverns often performing with [[Mattrim 'Threestrings' Mereg|Threestrings]]. I joined COMIC as a teen and [[Navreyi]] became my guild representative. I took the stage name Xerxes Talidorai in the hopes of letting people forget who I once was. The Wightwater Port Authority never forgot. Once I turned 18, I was contacted by the Port Authority and advised that I was to report directly to them or face a warrant for my arrest. I knew that my father would protect me from anything too serious, so I went, not that I had much of a choice. I was conscripted into mandatory undercover service. I would begin infiltrating the Wightwater underground using Xerxes as cover. My assignment is to find the roots of and identify the leaders in the organized crime rings of Wightwater. Should be easy for one of the greatest actors in the city right? Especially one with a criminal background.
