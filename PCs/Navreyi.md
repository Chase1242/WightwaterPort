## Navreyi's great-grandmother Zufosu \<last name>
---
*When you were little, your grandfather told you a story of your great-grandmother Zufosu (choose last name when you are ready). He sat you on his lap, with pride and love shining in his eyes, and told you the tale of his mother...*

Before the creation of [[Wightwater|Wightwater Port]], when [[Yttria]] (name for the [[Faewild]]) was still largely unsettled by races fettered with rules and laws, when the influence of the Faewild was present and strong, Zufosu was a strong-willed Satyr, who roamed the [[Chorad Forests]], loving the peace that existed between the elementals and the Fae peoples. It became apparent however, that Yttria was under attack from civilization.

Her parents said that encounters with adventuring parties of those who called themselves civilized happened much more frequently than when they were her age, disrupting the flow of the forests and the land. The fateful day came when [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]], [[Sagillus Wightwater]], and the rest of their adventuring party, sealed the [[Rift to the Elemental Plane]], closing the elementals on this plane off from their homes. She explained that the death of the Ancient Earth Elemental [[Oria]] shook the Faewild to it's core. Most fae peoples believed [[Oria]] unable to be killed, and in fact, visiting them was often seen as a spiritual rite of passage for the satyrs, and many other beings in the Faewild. She also said that you could almost feel the weave tremble with the death of such a great presence. The harbor of Wightwater is where Oria stood, as large as a mountain, the guardian of the rift.

It is not known how the Rift came to be--that story was lost long ago. Some say it came with the change of ages, from the Age of Dormant Magic to the Age of Rampant Magic. Some say an old chaotic being, Tharizdun, ripped the planes in an attempt to conquer them. All of that is speculation, but me? I believe Oria was called to the plane to serve some purpose, and the Rift is what they did to come here.

Well, anyway, with the death of Oria and the vanishing of most elementals from the plane, the peace of Yttria faded, and the rules of men, dwarves, and elves descended upon the Faewild, and ever so slowly did the Faewild fade. Our clans' histories mention being a nomadic people, and some of the scholars among us theorize that Yttria never stayed in one place for too long. It moved around the world, gracing uninhabited parts of the land with the magic of the Fae peoples.

The peace of the Faewild was sacred to the Archfey, and some said [[Titania, Summer Queen|Titania, the Summer Queen]], had a personal feud with High Mage Radelia for killing Oria and sealing the Rift, effectively destroying the peace the Faewild cherished. Without the elementals, settlers didn't fear dying in a fiery storm, an earthquake, or waking up in a flooded home, so they moved in, with Ebros making a large stab to gain control of what is named the [[Qinqen River]] today, after Radelia. The satyrs and other fae were pushed out, and while some moved to the cities, others moved to find the Faewild and thrive once more in that wonderful place. Zufosu despised those who called themselves civilized, and wanted nothing to do with the rules, laws, destruction, and disease that cities bring.

She told me that one day, she was sitting under a tree, listening to the wind sing a soft melody through the trees, when a flash of sunlight flickered rapidly in front of her eyes and she saw a cave lit only by a deep, blue glow. Then, she said she was called by the [[Oracle of Change|The Seer of Coming Times]], an outer member of the [[Seelie Court]], to adventure the islands in between the continents, known to many sailors as the [[Dead Man's Waters]], and find what may lie in wait in the coming times. 

You see, your great-grandmother, she had an indomitable spirit, with a fire in her stomach to explore! And the call to journey across the world spoke to something deep within her soul. She journeyed away from the Chorad Forests, across the treacherous [[Shayar Mountain Range]], through the [[Great Swamp of the Baglian Empire]], to the city of Sulzheim, gaining druidic powers along the way. She became strong enough to face what may await her at the island in the epicenter of Dead Man's Waters.

Most sane ship captains still refuse to sail there, and most of those who do sail there don't make it back. Zufosu, luckily enough, found a captain who was said to have lost his wits long ago. He went by the name of [[Throckmorton]], a genius sailor who claimed to have a unique way of sailing such that he could go anywhere others said they couldn't. She boarded the ship, knowing that a summon from an Archfey wasn't something she could afford to pass by, lest she draw the ire of Lady Future. She also knew Throckmorton may be one of the only captains who *would* sail into those waters. 

She detailed the Dead Man's Waters with sharp rocks jutting out of the surface, large sea creatures following the wake of the ship, and a mist so dense it was hard to see but one step ahead of your own two feet.  Well, during the second day of journeying through the waters--

*He made a noise of water erupting, throwing you into the air and catching you lightly*

--Just like that! A giant squid came out of the water, threatening to bring the ship and the crew down into the cold, dark depths of the ocean. She said (and I don't believe this part) they fought for five hours before they killed the squid. The crew ate calamari for days afterward. 

They docked off the shore of the main island, and something called to her. She got on the island, and listened to the soft melody of the wind, guiding her where she needed to go. She found the cave, and presumably, Lady Future, but... she never told me what happened in that cave with the deep blue light. She came back with a flute of gold, silver, and ivory. She said her journey was uneventful back home, and she moved into Wightwater's Port. Your great-grandpappy, he had already moved into Wightwater, and well, they met, fell in love, and had me and my four siblings. My dad, he worked a couple jobs, the most notable being a vintner for the Vintners, Distillers, and Brewers Guild, where he only achieved a journey-satyr status. My mother, she played that flute around town, at taverns, even making it to a minor noble's ball as one of the acts at the party.

When she played the flute, you could *almost see* the story she was trying to tell with the melody. You could feel the colors and emotions. Since I am the last one of my siblings, I have the flute, and maybe you will have it too, one day. 

*He ended the story with a wistful look and tears brimming the edges of his eyes.*

*Each time he told that story, he would come up with a different sea monster that terrorized Zufosu, and each time it made you giggle and laugh as he tickled you.*
