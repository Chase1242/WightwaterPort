Born to an elven mother who cherished knowledge and grace, and a human father known for his hard work, loyalty, and determination, he grew up at the crossroads of two worlds. Even as a young child, he was naturally inquisitive—constantly asking questions, poking through old books, and watching people with wide-eyed fascination. His family lived in a struggling, close-knit community, where he spent his days wandering the streets and bustling markets, captivated by the stories of travelers and townsfolk alike. Each tale of distant lands and forgotten secrets only fed the burning curiosity that had lived within him since birth.

Tragedy struck early—his mother died when he was still young. In her absence, his father, a man who valued structure and labor over abstract ideals, tried to raise him the only way he knew how: through discipline and hard work. He pushed his son to bury his questions, to quiet the yearning for knowledge. Curiosity, he believed, was a distraction from survival.

But the more he was told to suppress it, the stronger his hunger for understanding became.

At fifteen, unable to ignore the call any longer, he ran away. He had overheard a traveler whispering about a strange trail leading to something ancient—something forgotten. Compelled by the mystery, he followed the path deep into the wilds. Eventually, it led him to a cave carved with cryptic symbols. At its end stood a worn statue, vaguely humanoid but wrong in proportions—alien, unknowable.

As he approached, he heard whispers. They echoed softly through the stone chamber, speaking his name, offering guidance, knowledge, power. The voice was both comforting and terrifying, like an old lullaby sung backward. He felt something pull at his mind, drawing him in.

Then, suddenly, fear overtook him. He broke free of the trance and fled, heart pounding, back toward home.

But when he arrived, everything had changed. His father lay cold and lifeless on the floor. No signs of struggle. No explanation. Just silence.

Grief and guilt consumed him. _If only he had known more. If only he had been wiser, stronger—he could have saved him._

In his desperation, he returned to the cave. He fell to his knees before the statue, no longer afraid, and begged. He pleaded for knowledge, for power—anything to ensure he would never again be helpless. Anything to prevent another loss.

Unbeknownst to him, the statue was an ancient idol of **Juiblex**, the Faceless Lord, an entity of madness and decay.

And Juiblex answered.

It granted him insight, eldritch secrets whispered through the dark, in exchange for his undying loyalty.
