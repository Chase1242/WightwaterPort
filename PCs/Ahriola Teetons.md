## Backstory

Ahriola was born in the very heart of the Faewild, in a small, vibrant village nestled deep in the forest, just beyond the bustling city of Wightwater Port. She was the youngest of three daughters in a loving, close-knit family. Their home was a marvel, built within the sturdy embrace of an [[Ancient Trees|ancient whispering tree]], adorned with cheerful flowers and whimsical mushroom embellishments. Ahriola's days were a joyful communion with her family and nature itself, learning the gentle ways of a forest fairy druid. Her parents, wise in the old ways, taught her and her four sisters to prepare intricate spells and potent potions. Often, Ahriola joined her sisters and father on trips into Wightwater Port to trade their magical wares.

This year, the annual town festival held special significance. It was Ahriola’s first festival as a new adult, and her loving mother had tasked her with finding the most exquisite spider silk in shades of emerald and silver for a special gown. Arriving in Wightwater, Ahriola immediately sought out Jalester, the city's most well-connected citizen, known for his ample knowledge of merchants and gossip. Her father often consulted Jalester for leads, and Ahriola knew she'd find him holding court in one of the city's lively bars.

As luck would have it, [[Jalester Silvermane|Jalester]] was conversing with a strikingly [[The HandsomeFae|handsome fae]], whose very presence instantly captivated Ahriola. Delighted, she made her way over. "Master Jalester," she began, "I'm searching for the finest spider silk."

The dangerous fae, with eyes that held a thrilling glint, chimed in. "I can lead you to a merchant with such treasures."

What followed was an enchanting adventure through the market. Ahriola and the fae moved from stall to stall, discovering the most exquisite silks. Throughout their shared quest, Ahriola found herself utterly charmed by the handsome fae. As the market visit drew to a close, Ahriola, emboldened by their shared delight, asked him to meet her later at her village's largest, most ancient maple tree—a well-known meeting spot for new lovers. The fae accepted, his smile hinting at untold secrets.

### The Festival and a Fateful Wait
---
On the day of the festival, Ahriola was a vision. She wore her new handkerchief spider silk gown, expertly crafted by her doting mother. It was exactly as she had wished: emerald green, shimmering with exquisitely embroidered silver stars. She and her sisters laughed, danced beneath the town's abundant lanterns, and drank ample amounts of mead.

As fatigue began to set in, her family decided to leave the town's festivities. Ahriola, however, fluttered off, her heart full of anticipation, towards the ancient maple tree. She gleefully waited for her new potential prospect.

But he never showed.

Annoyed, a slow, burning frustration began to simmer beneath Arhiola's delight. The beautiful night now felt tainted by his absence. As she slowly walked back to her family's willow tree home, she gathered magic mushrooms along the way, planning to lick their caps for much-needed mental relief.

### A Home Shattered
---
When Ahriola finally arrived at her home, she found it in disarray. Her heart plummeted as she stepped inside. The air was thick with a chilling silence, and the once-vibrant space was ruined. Her family… they were gone, brutally murdered.

And there, standing by their family hearth, casually helping himself to yesterday's leftover dinner, was the handsome fae. The very one who had enchanted her, who had promised a meeting, and then had left her waiting while he committed this unspeakable act. His eyes, once so captivating, now held a cold, malevolent amusement. The betrayal was a fresh, searing wound on top of unimaginable grief.

### Ahrie's vow
---
Given that Ahrie was still a young fairy brimming with magical talent, her inability to execute spells proficiently allowed her new enemy to leave her home unscathed. Fueled by a burning desire for revenge against her newfound enemy, Ahrie ventured into the vast forest, wandering for years in search of her adversary. Along her journey, she forged strong friendships, most notably with her best friend, [[Brindle 'Lickleaf' Nackle|Brindle]].
