## Backstory
Tazpin “THE STRONGEST WIZARD”

Once, in a peaceful realm of Knowledge, Nature, and Afternoon Naps, there was a gnome who couldn’t sit still.

His name was Tazpin, and he shouted his name with pride. Self-declared as “THE STRONGEST WIZARD,” Tazpin meant it… mostly in terms of biceps, but in his heart, he believed it meant everything. Arcane power. Physical might. Competitive spirit. Hand axe throwing distance.

He was a walking contradiction—a gnome who spent his life trying to prove he was the best by challenging anyone to anything. Wrestling contests, drinking games, spell duels, push-up battles, poetry slams. If someone claimed to be good at something, Tazpin needed to be better. It was the rule.

The Spark of Magic

Tazpin began with brute strength. He trained endlessly with his hand axe, hurling it with the force of a falling star. But his whole life changed when a wizard defeated him without lifting a finger. Just a smug look, a flick of the wrist—and he was suddenly suspended midair like a confused hamster.

Enraged and inspired, he swore, “I will become stronger than that smug NERD!”

He dedicated a century to the arcane arts—grinding spell books like gym reps. He trained under [[Jim Fizzlekin]], a planes-hopping wizard who taught him two things:

-Magic isn’t just about spells—it’s about imagination.

-There are other wizards out there to /beat/.

Under Jim’s tutelage, Tazpin became a formidable mage… without ever skipping leg day. He enchanted his custom spell book to always display the night sky over his hometown and had it bound in magical leather he personally wrestled off a planar bull-beast.

After one last family meal (and arm-wrestling his father for dessert), he trounced his old rival in a magical duel, flexed, winked, and ripped open a planar portal with his bare hands.

The Planar Pilgrim

Over the next 200 years, Tazpin roamed the multiverse like a shooting star fueled by protein shakes and pure willpower:

On a battle world, he entered a grand tournament and defeated a trash-talking blowhard who became a bitter rival.

In a realm of gearworks and steam, he fell in love with a gentle orc engineer who crafted him a magical clockwork bird—one that sang a new tune each time it chirped.

In a shadow-touched forest, he saved villagers from a horde… only to discover they were controlled townsfolk. He muttered an apology, flexed awkwardly, and plane-shifted right out of there.

Each new plane, he had star charts tattooed onto his body—a growing map of his interplanar journey etched in celestial ink.

The Fall

One day, he felt a pull—a mysterious summons to a new realm. Curious, he followed it. But instead of a challenge, he found a trap.

A slender, hooded figure awaited him. Tazpin was ambushed, restrained, and had his beloved spell book stolen. He remembers vague whispers… a cruel voice saying:

“If it survives, drop it on the streets with this scroll.”

What followed was pain, light, and darkness. He awoke in a filthy alley with a handful of coppers, a pounding headache, and no memory of who he really was—only fragments:

His name.

A burning certainty that he is THE STRONGEST WIZARD.

A couple of spells, muscle memory (literally), and a deep yearning to travel again.

Rebirth

With nothing but instinct and delusion, Tazpin found work as a humble scribe. His exaggerated stories amused the locals—especially a man named Jalester Silverman, who shared gossip and took a liking to the eccentric gnome. Even Durnan, the barkeep, tolerated him (eventually offering a free flagon… for silence).

Through shady dealings, he met a tiefling named Xerxes Talidorai, who provided him with magical equipment—at a price. To repay his debt (and follow the itch of forgotten purpose), Tazpin asked to join Xerxes’ adventures.

It feels familiar.

The fire inside him burns again.

He doesn't know what was taken from him—or who took it—but one thing is clear:

“I AM THE STRONGEST WIZARD!”

And he’s going to prove it. Again.
