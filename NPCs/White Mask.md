## Who they are
A White Mask is a person in night-black clothing with no skin exposed, with a softly glowing white mask. They are under direct control (magically sworn/bound) to the [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]]. Each one has a different specialty. If someone is able to look under the white mask and clothes, they find a horribly disfigured sight, with scar tissue from a burn for skin, missing ears, webbed fingers, and small black dots for eyes.

## Differences
Each White Mask (order from 1-13), one for each class, specializing in one thing or another.
