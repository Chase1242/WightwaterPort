## The White Masks

### Who They Are
- **Created recently**, within the last few months, as [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen|Radelia's]] arcane mechanism nears completion.
- Serve two main purposes:
  - **Harvest magical power and mortal souls** to fuel her infernal-powered engine.
  - Silences those who get too close to the truth.

### Appearance
- Dressed entirely in **pitch-black robes**, with no skin visible.
- Wear **softly glowing white masks**, magically bound to Radelia.
- **Each specializes** in a different skill: assassination, illusion, magic extraction, etc.

### Under the Mask
- Disfigured husks:
  - Burn-scarred skin
  - Missing ears
  - Webbed or clawed fingers
  - Black pinprick eyes
- Likely **soul-bound constructs**, their humanity stripped through infernal binding.
### The Mask
Putting on the mask causes enchantment magic to fall upon the wearer, and without saving, they would be controlled by the High Mage.
