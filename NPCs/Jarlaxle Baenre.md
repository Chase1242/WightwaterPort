Jarlaxle Baenre is a drow swashbuckler and the secret lord of [[Dikon]], the City of Sails.
Jarlaxle plans to use the cache of dragons to buy his way into the Lords' Alliance, a confederation of cities and towns that band together against common threats. Jarlaxle also wants the *[[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon]]* for leverage in his negotiations. In the magical guise of a human sea captain named [[Zardoz Zord]], Jarlaxle runs a traveling carnival called the [[Sea Maidens Faire]] and lairs aboard a ship in [[Wightwater|Wightwater's]] harbor that has a submarine (the [[Scarlet Marpenoth]]) underneath it, as described in chapter 7. 
Jarlaxle delights in thwarting his enemies, enjoys the complications that arise when adventurers try to meddle in his affairs, and loves to see the looks on their faces when he finally gets the better of them. He doesn't suffer fools who threaten him, however. If forced into a violent confrontation, he swiftly and brutally kills someone to make an example of them and then walks off. If you choose Jarlaxle as the villain, the adventure takes place in the autumn.
