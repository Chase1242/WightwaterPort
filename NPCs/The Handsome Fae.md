- The Handsome Fae, the form this [Faerie Dragon](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#faerie%20dragon%20(violet)_mm) likes to take the most, is the form in which he likes to present to the world
- He was given his Warlock powers by the Great Old One [[Kronos]] through the Hag of Kronos [[Cailleach Mháthair]]
- He has been around for over 400 years and though is only a Faerie Dragon is a 14-18 CR creature
- He has been tasked to help bring to fruition the vision that the Hag of Kronos saw, the future that allows Kronos to reform on this plane
- Through that he had to a couple important things:
	- He contracted on with [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]] to help her bring the [[MBCSC]] to life
	- He murdered [[Ahrie Ola Teetons]] family in a gruesome way, with chunks viciously ripped out of her parents heads, and her siblings in a similar way, on orders to retrieve a magical item from her family (tbd)
	- Along this line, he murdered the [[House Elowyn|Elowyn]] noble family for their well-kept secret trove of magical items - mainly for the [Well of Many Worlds](https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#well%20of%20many%20worlds_dmg) in addition to 10 items rolled from [Magic Item Table G](https://2014.5e.tools/tables.html#magic%20item%20table%20g_dmg) and 3 items from [Magic Item Table H](https://2014.5e.tools/tables.html#magic%20item%20table%20h_dmg). 
	- The Handsome Fae was told Aldarian would come to Kronos, and to aid that, and as such, planted the ideas of knowledge and adventure in Aldarian's head from time to time.
	- When Radelia noticed [[Tazpin Stararm]] jumping around the planes - following his magical residue, THF ambushed him, taking him to the MBCSC to sap his magical energy to help power the machine. 
	- He helps Radelia but works on installing something that will let him open up the portal to the [[Pit of Tartarus]] instead of the Hells, pulling all of Kronos into the plane
