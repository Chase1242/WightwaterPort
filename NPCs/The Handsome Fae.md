The Handsome Fae is an actor that is a warlock of [[Kronos]], the same as [[Aldarian Woods]]. 

The Handsome Fae poisoned Aldarian's mother, and when he went on an adventure to find knowledge, killed his father.

The Handsome Fae slaughtered [[Ahrie Ola Teetons]] as well.

The Handsome Fae works for [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]], and is the grunt that sapped [[Tazpin Stararm]] of his powers.

The Handsome Fae received orders from the Hag that grew from the piece of Kronos that landed on this plane to do what he did. Kronos saw part of the interaction between the [[Oracle of Change]] and [[Zufosu]], who was told of a prophecy that 5 sentient beings will decide the fate of the plane.

The Handsome Fae was told to insert himself with Radelia as a helper to help push her to the fate that brings Kronos back
