# Zufosu
---
Zufosu was a young and upcoming satyr when [[Oria]] was slain and the [[Rift to the Elemental Plane]] was closed by [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen|Radelia Qinqen]] and [[Sagillus Wightwater]]. Having visited the both the Rift and Oria in the past few years, she knew the what the loss of Oria meant.

She was against the settlement of the Faewild by the dwarves, men, and other folk. They brought deforestation, rules, laws, and disrupted the very cycle of the land. So, when she was called by [[Oracle of Change|Lady Future]], an Archfey who sees what the weaves of the future holds, she felt in her very soul that she was destined to do something important for the Archfey, to bring down the city and restore the Faewild.

What she didn't tell her son, [[Stom]], about her adventure before she settled down with her husband, is what happened in that cave. And, she wasn't certain she would ever be able to tell *anyone* what had happened in there, even if she wasn't bound by the magic of the Oracle of Change.

When she arrived on the island, she left [[Throckmorton]] behind, against his protests, believing he should protect her. He backed off, determined to find treasure on the island before Zufosu returned.

She didn't receive directions from Lady Future, she was just left with a gut feeling on how to get there (which definitely saved the ship a couple times). She followed where her legs took her, off into the mists. In those mists, she could almost see shadows in the mists and she could almost make out voices she *thought* she knew... but she couldn't quite get it. The shadows were always just out of sight, and the voices a little too soft to make out. After a treacherous trip up a jagged mountainside, she reached a cave, that went down. She followed it even after the last light disappeared behind her, following what she knew to be the path. She jumped some ravines, clambered over rocks, and finally, ever so slowly, she could start to see a blue, ambient light.

Zufosu walked into a cavern with large stalactites hanging from the ceiling, and large stalagmites growing up to the ceiling. The air was damp and musty, as if this air has been unperturbed for a thousand years - or more.

In the middle of a cavern sat a slender, cross-legged feminine figure, with her eyes closed. In the middle of her forehead, a large blue sapphire rested on her forehead, attached to a chain woven into her hair. In the blue light, it was hard to tell, but she thought it was a dark brown. This figure rested above a perfectly circular pool, and in that pool, a water still enough to look like glass.

After a couple minutes in this silence, Zufosu was about to speak up, to announce and introduce herself when the eyes of the Archfey, the Oracle of Change, flung open, an arm raising to point to her. Her eyes locked with Zufosu's, deep pools of swirling greens and blues, drawing Zufosu in, and the Oracle whipped her head at the pool, looking into the still waters, forcing Zufosu's head to follow.

Zufosu saw her futures in there, what seemed like every possible one. Ones ending in tragedy, in happiness, and in loss. She saw her life fade due to her own hands, her partners hands, the hands of bandits. Many of the futures though, many of them coincided down a similar path... A life in the newly minted city of [[Wightwater|Wightwater's Port]], married to a satyr who had moved to the city already. She saw further, past her own life, and the life of her kids, to several futures where the city thrived, the city was wiped from the planet. What stuck with her the most though were the following possibilities. 

The city, and eventually part of the plane, succumbs to the Blood War and fires of Avernus, dragged to the Hells after years of fighting the devils because a new rift between the Hells and this plane, is torn in the same place as the old Rift, where the planes sit close together, weakening the barrier between them.

She saw the city standing tall and proud, a display of architecture and art unlike any other, with 5 adventurers sloshing drinks together at an unfamiliar tavern. This flashes to battles around a huge machine, glowing with arcane energy flowing through runes of the Hells, with the machine shutting down in the end, and Radelia Qinqen dead over a panel.

The third possibility was by far the most harrowing. She saw the rift tear open between two planes, but this time, it wasn't the Hells, but the horrors of the Abyss and Far Realms flowing into the plane. There was no salvation for those on the Material Plane this time.

In each of these futures, the same 5 adventurers were at the heart of the battle before the rift was torn open, and the actions of one in their party could cause the destruction of the plane.

After what felt like days, she came to, dazed, laying on her back, with deep scratch marks down her cheeks, bleeding profusely. Her face ached, and her hands felt raw on the cool surface of the cave. There was blood on the ground as well, and she could tell her fingers were ripped to shreds.

She got to her knees, tears in her eyes, and uttered two words.

>*Why me?*

The Oracle spoke, a soft raspy voice that did not fit the figure of the lady sitting across the pool.

>You have been chosen by the Summer Queen herself. Your life is a pivotal point through which the future is balanced. Precariously. Each action you choose will steer the world to salvation, doom, or war that will cause untold suffering. I will bestow upon you one gift of three. A flute, a shield, or a sword.

The shield and sword had metal, so Zufosu chose the flute, a beautifully carved flute of ivory, with gold and silver adorning the flute. The threads were so fine it was almost embroidery.

That flute, when the spell was played correctly, replayed that exact sequence to the one playing the flute. The flute player could also add memories and thoughts to the flute.  (unsure about this rn, but I am gonna think on it)

After this event, she was teleported to the ship, and she left.
