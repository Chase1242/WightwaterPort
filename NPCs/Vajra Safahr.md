- Friends with [[Renaer Neverember]]
- [[Qinqen Tower]] is a fortress and a wizard training academy all in one. From here, Vajra Safahr watches over the city and asserts herself as Qinnen. Sending spells are her preferred way of communicating with her operatives. Vajra offers the characters membership in the Gray Hands, a private security force under her command. She doles out missions designed to tax the characters' resources and test their loyalty to Waterdeep. Characters who complete these missions won't gain enough renown to join Force Grey yet, but they will gain something valuable: the Qinnen's patronage. Vajra continues to take an interest in their adventuring careers, helping out when she can.
