# Corwin FibbleWibble

## Backstory
Corwin is [[Xerxes (fake) - Fleet Fibblewibble|Fleet's]] adoptive father. 
- He took in Fleet after Fleet was the orchestrated fall guy in a plan of a local crime boss, taking pity on him rather than doling out a harsh punishment.
	- Corwin knew that Fleet wasn't a bad kid, just unlucky enough to be a kid who was fending for himself, in a big city, where a picture bigger than Fleet set him up to fail.
	- Part of Corwin also knew that this kid was even more unlucky because he was a tiefling; he was the byproduct of his parents having dealings with devils
- Corwin provided Fleet with a steady home life, schooling, and an in to a job to help the city, to pay back for the crimes he committed
	- Fleet took on the stage name of Xerxes, and ditched the last name to distance himself from his magistrate father - to help keep his disguise.
	- Fleet, through Corwin, is a spy for the city into the inner workings of local crime gangs and such
- Finding Fleet's true parents (not that Corwin would give up Fleet) became a hobby of Corwin's 
	- His connections with the city allowed extensive record searching for people who were caught dealing with devils
	- Early on, he turned up dead end's for every lead he followed up on
	- One thing that caught Corwin's eye are the mobility of the noble families, a couple few that had been in decline for a couple generations, or some that started on the up and up. 
	- Fortune in [[Wightwater]] is somewhat hard to come by, as becoming a noble family is quite the process, establishing a generational wealth is something few ever do.
	- But a couple families, on the decline as previously mentioned (the [[Cassalanter's]] and the [[Onyxcutter|Onyxcutter's]])
	- Investigation into the two families produced some ill-begotten gains by the Onyxcutter's, but most of the Cassalanter's resurgence was mysteriously gained, with no real explanation as to why. 
		- Corwin questioned a couple people related to the Cassalanter's and decided that it was probable to be the Cassalanter's due to the weird resurgence of the family - timed with the approximate age of Fleet, was almost enough of an indication. It was unlikely that the commonfolk really got into dealings with the devils, as evidenced by the scarcity of the tieflingfolk
## Larger relation to the story
- Two real options to tie Corwin into the story
- A) Kill him off via THF - he was getting too close to the truth about [[High Mage Radelia Qinqen]] and THF was dispatched to silence him
- B) He was too close to finding out about the Cassalanter's ties to [[Asmodeus]] and Titivilus (which in turn leads to Radelia someway)
### The way to do it
- As Corwin has suspected the Cassalanter's for several years, he has never had concrete evidence. In the recent month, in an investigation into a fraud report of the Cassalanter's, he finally had credible evidence to look into some of the sealed documents of the Cassalanter's. This afforded him the knowledge that the Cassalanter's had three children, the first of which had a birthday similar to Fleet's, and two girls who are younger than Fleet. 
- The Cassalanter's have to be notified when their sealed records are accessed, and by whom
	- They know it is Corwin FibbleWibble
	- To keep him quiet, they decide the best path to pursue is to kidnap Corwin
		- They also think they can add him to one of the 99 souls for their sacrifice easily
	- He is kidnapped and his house ransacked
	- A newspaper is put out about the disappearance of a magistrate and Fleet receives a letter from Corwin about his history
	- Tie the Cassalanter's to Asmodeus and Titivilus - with some circumstantial ties to Radelia somehow
