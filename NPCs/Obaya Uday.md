*NG female Aldeanian human priest of Waukeen*

Obaya, a priest, has traveled from [[Aldeani]] to sponsor expeditions into Undermountain, with the goal of bringing its magical treasures back to her employer, the merchant prince [[Wakanga O'tamu]] of [[Port Robles]]. She discourages low-level adventurers from exploring Undermountain but is happy to help them with her magic until they gain enough experience to be useful to her.

If you plan to run Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage after this adventure, Obaya can take on a more prominent role as an advisor and a source of quests.
