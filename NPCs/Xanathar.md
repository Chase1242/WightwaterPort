Xanathar is a paranoid, megalomaniacal beholder crime lord whose goal is to wipe out anyone it perceives as a Zhentarim operative or sympathizer, retrieve the [[Stone of Golorr]], and secure the cache of dragons. Its base is a dungeon under [[Skullport]], a subterranean settlement beneath [[Wightwater]]. This lair is described in chapter 5. 

Xanathar has a healthy fear of [[Laeral Silverhand]] and is inclined to spare those in her employ, to avoid provoking a conflict with Wightwater's Open Lord. Adventurers who incur the wrath of the beholder can use its fear of Laeral to escape certain death. 

If you choose Xanathar as the villain, the adventure takes place in the spring.
