## Original story
The High Mage Radelia is a widely respected wizard, known to be a friend to [[Sagillus Wightwater]], the founder of the city 200 years ago. She has been here since the start and was always known to be kind and benevolent.

She is widely regarded as the final voice of authority on the [[Council of Wightwater]], often swaying important votes on things effecting Wightwater.

## Stitched together version
More than two centuries ago, the **Kingdom of Ebros** grew weary of reports from the frontier: wild elemental storms ravaged the land, strange quakes and fires destroyed crops, and settlers spoke of a mysterious region—**Yttria**—that no one could tame.

To address the chaos, Ebros dispatched elite adventuring parties to investigate and, if possible, end the elemental threat. Among them was a team led by the stoic warrior **Sagillus Wightwater** and the brilliant young eladrin mage, **Radelia Qinqen**.

After weeks of perilous travel, they found the source: a tear between the **Material Plane** and the **Elemental Planes**, guarded by a massive **Earth elemental**, more ancient than time. Elementals poured from the breach, making settlement impossible.

But the adventurers were not alone. In secret, the archdevil **Titivilus** had already taken an interest in Radelia. Sensing her brilliance and her boundless hunger for understanding, he began whispering to her in meditation. His voice was never heard, only felt — the shiver of an idea that felt like her own.

It was **Titivilus** who destabilized the Elemental Planes and **timed the flood** to reach its peak as the party arrived. As they prepared to seal the breach, the rift erupted. The Earth elemental fell, and **Sagillus was mortally wounded**. Planar magic screamed as the tear tried to collapse inward, threatening to take the Material with it.

> _“Say the words…”_

Radelia whispered:  
**"I want to make a deal."**

Time froze. A refined figure in elegant robes stepped into the stillness—**[[Titivilus]]**, veiled in illusion.

He offered her everything:

- Power to destroy the elementals.
- Magic to seal the rift forever.
- Enough strength to keep Sagillus.

The price? A **lock of her hair**, a piece of self and soul—and a promise: to meet again for an **“appropriate sacrifice.”**

She accepted.

The deal was struck. Elementals scoured. Portal sealed.

Ebros hailed them as heroes. With the elemental threat gone, they were granted settlers and resources to found a port city: **[[Wightwater|Wightwater’s Port]]**, at the mouth of the newly named **[[Qinqen River]]**, in Radelia’s honor.

Radelia took a seat on the **Council of Wightwater**, quickly rising to become its most powerful voice. She and Sagillus led the city into an age of peace and prosperity for fifty years—until his death.

But the bargain remained.

Radelia, in secret, began researching a new form of arcane power: a device that could **cast wide-area battlefield control spells**—a last defense, she believed, against future threats like enemy armies or the elemental tide.

This would become the **Arcane Engine**—a mechanism that required tremendous magical energy to operate.

To power it, she turned to **magical beings**—not  innocents, but of those she deemed wasted potential: prisoners, failed mages, the dying, the forgotten. Some were magical creatures; others, simply bound by ritual and reshaped.

Thus were born the **White Masks**.

Each was cloaked in night-black cloth, their bodies hidden. Their only visible feature: a **softly glowing white mask**, bound with infernal script. Each had unique abilities and a mind irrevocably tied to Radelia's will.

Beneath the robes lay a horror:

- **Burned skin**, charred by the binding process.
- **Webbed fingers**, reshaped by magic.
- **Black dots for eyes**, empty of light or thought.

They served as her enforcers, spies, assassins—and above all, collectors of **fuel** for the machine.

Yet despite her secrecy, Radelia believed she was still doing good. That the ends justified the means. That the **Arcane Engine** would protect Wightwater in its darkest hour. She was cleaning up the streets and protecting other innocent people.

But Titivilus had _not_ been idle.

His whispers subtly shaped the machine’s design, introducing a flaw—a backdoor of sorts. Though powered by souls, **the engine also thins the barrier between the Material Plane and the Hells**, bleeding infernal energy with every activation.

Radelia doesn't know.

To fulfill her part of the pact—**described as an appropriate price**—she has begun orchestrating war from the shadows. Using intermediaries and agents, she fans the flames within the **[[Kingdom of Blou Gral]]**, provoking a march on Wightwater.

The city scrambles to prepare. Radelia urges calm, knowing she will soon activate her machine in battle—and complete the devil's tally.

She believes she can control it.

She believes she is saving Wightwater.

But the infernal flaw runs deep.

And the devil’s price is coming due.
