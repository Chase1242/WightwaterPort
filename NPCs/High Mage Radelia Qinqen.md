### Personality Trait
I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition.

### Ideal
No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic)

### Bond
I work to preserve my best friend's city, Wightwater's Port.

### Flaw
Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilization (the mass spellcaster thingamajig).
