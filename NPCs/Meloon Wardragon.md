*NE male Chondathan human adventurer under the control of an intellect devourer*

Meloon Wardragon (see appendix B) comes across as a cheery, optimistic, warm-hearted man eager to fight alongside those he considers his friends. The Yawning Portal staff and many of the regular guests know that Meloon is a skilled fighter with ties to [[Force Grey]]. 

An intellect devourer in league with Xanathar ate Meloon's brain several months ago. Now under the monster's control, Meloon actively discourages adventurers from exploring Undermountain and urges them to focus on conflicts in the city instead. He also hunts down and kills Zhentarim operatives for his secret beholder master. He has his eye on [[Davil Starsong]] (see appendix B) but won't kill the elf in plain view of witnesses.
