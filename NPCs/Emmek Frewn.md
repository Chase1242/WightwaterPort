- Business rival to the [[Pixiedust Manor]] if the PCs decide to fix up the tavern
## Goals
- Emmek wants his pub to be the most successful tavern in the [[North Harbor]], and he wants the characters' business to fail spectacularly.
## Assets
- Emmek is stingy when it comes to certain kinds of expenses and foolish with his coin in other ways. He tends to spend a lot on big, showy items and cut corners on the little amenities. Because he doesn't have much coin to throw around right now, his plan to ruin the characters' establishment begins with borrowing some money.
## Plans
- Emmek secures a 150 gp loan from Istrid Horn (see appendix B). He spends 50 gp for the services of the [[Shard Shunners]], a gang of halfling wererats with which he has had nefarious dealings in the past. He pays the halflings to hinder the characters' efforts while he works feverishly to manage his own business.
- Four gang members have been assigned to work with Emmek: two males named Kelso Fiddlewick and Dasher Snobeedle. and two females named Danika Fiddlewick (Kelso's younger sister) and Brynn Hilltopple. These halflings are **wererats**, with these changes:
	- Each wererat is small and has 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points.
	- It has these racial traits: It can move through the space of a medium or larger creature. It has advantage on saving throws against being frightened. It speaks Common and Halfling, and it knows thieves' cant.
- Emmek's strategy for ruining the competition and the consequences for putting it into action are summarized in the table below.

| Event   | The wererats scope out the characters' tavern in halfling forms and might try to get jobs there.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Event   | The wererats plant morsels of food inside the characters' place and bore tiny holes in the outside walls to attract rats, creating an infestation.                                                                                                   |
| Action  | Emmek spreads rumors that the characters' tavern is rat-infested, which is why he didn't buy it. Apply a -10 penalty on the next three rolls characters make on the Running a Business table (see "Tavern Keeping Expenses," page 41).               |
| Event   | The Shard Shunners claim they've done enough for their coin and demand more.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Action  | Emmek pays the wererats another 50 gp to creep around the characters' tavern at night in hybrid and rat form, carve rat faces into the doors of neighbors, and otherwise draw attention to themselves.                                               |
| Action  | Emmek convinces several local residents to sign a letter he has drafted, then dispatches it to the City Watch. The letter accuses the characters of running a front for a guild of wererat thieves and urges the Watch to close their establishment. |
